This is not the case. This game is genuinely a masterpiece and i have never played a game that made me feel so many emotions that range all over the spectrum, i mean hell I thought The Last of Us was emotional as hell. one minute its happy then desparation then wanting to cry like a baby (points in the game specifically made me question my manhood due to how much i was trying to not break down like a baby) this game honestly does show alot of great points that are true in real life as well, like value those close to you and despite this being the internet and it not being known to be shown but, showing compassion and taking the time to give a helping hand could possibly save someones life. It is funny that a troll on tf2 would find such a great love and change of perspective from a game, call me names call me what ever the hell you like.

Yes.TL;DRBanished is a challenging (but fantastic) city builder which strays from the rest as it is not your typical city builder; instead of huge capital cities that we see in games like Cities: Skylines, Banished focuses on a small town with a low budget. Personally, I think it is one of the best games in the city building genre. That said, however, the AI of the villagers is rather mediocre, and at the moment there isn't a whole lot to it's (beautiful) bones. This game can provide hours of good, challenging fun, but don't come expecting anything like Cities: Skylines. Also note that this game is very hard, and may be frustrating to those new to the genre, even experienced city builders will also need to have a few tries to get used to it's somewhat complicated mechanics and challenge. Banished has a bit of a lack of tutorials, so don't expect that you will understand everything right away.Banished is fantastic and challenging, but don't come expecting another Cities: Skylines.After many tries and hours of understanding every little mechanic, I have finally formed a functional city with a good population. Yet in this game, someething, small or big, will fail, and everything will completely go down hill. That is the thing with Shining Rock Software's 2014 city builder Banished, there is and always will be an underlying threat. Whether it's famine, cold, a natural disaster, your town will eventually go to the pigs.Your town starts off with a few small, hopeful families, a storage barn, and a stock pile with not a hell of a lot of starting resources. You start off building a few small wooden houses, you make some gatherer's huts, forester lodges, nothing too big. Your town will slowly grow in population and size, and soon you have a city on your hands. However, don't expect it to be a Cities: Skylines type thing where you can just sit back and watch your city work, you need to keep your eyes on the game at all times. One time I had a town-wide famine, because the road from one of the gatherer's huts to the storage barn was too long. Couldn't understand why everyone kept dying of starvation. While it is occasionally very frustrating, it is a very addictive game, and sometimes when everything goes bad the game really shines. The dire need of resources, the feeling of hope, the game will immerse you. So, lets get into the pros and the cons.Pros-Addictive-Challenging-A blast of fresh air-Cool art style and general feel-Interesting seeing your town work and grow from the teamwork of all your villagers-Immersive-Lots to achieve and work to-Relatively simple-Pretty good map generation settings-Weather cycles which can mean life or death-Lots of different ways to approach things; you could use a gatherer to gather food from the forest, use aquired seeds to make farms, or maybe just buy all your resources off the trading post, you can decide-Villagers aren't just lifeless robots, they have needs and happiness which can be fulfilled in different ways-Natural disasters are a cool feature which you need to prepare for-Gives you a good overview of statistics in your townCons-Villager AI is mediocre at best-Not great control over a few different things like villager paths and resource management-Not a hell of a lot on it's bones yet-Lack of tutorials, just throws you in the deep end-UI can be a little hard to navigate-Some resources like rocks are not unlimited, and will eventually run out (this takes a long time though)-Annoying little bugs which can destroy your cityWell, that's basically that. Banished has a fair share of cons, just like any game, but I personally think it deserves a solid 8.5/10It serves as a fantastic ant farm simulator as well, seeing your people evolve and grow, seeing them get all wiped out (fun). It is one of my favourites in the city builder genre and any experienced city builder should pick up this game, but even newbies to the the genre can pick up this game and have fun.",2015,2

So there it sat in my vast Steam library, not really doing anything. And then, my friend told me about a really good city-builder that he had been playing. I thought, ""oh Simcity, right?"" Wrong. He was talking about Tropico, (Tropico 5 however). At this time, I had forgotten that I even had it. So, when I looked it up on the steam store, I realised that I already had it. So, I gave it a shot. And I was quite presently surprised! So, here is a list explaining the good and bad elements of Tropico 4 and there reasons.Pros+Each little person has their own profile;What was one of the elements that made Tropico stand out was the ability to click on every little person walking around, doing there daily routine. Once you clicked on them, a profile of the character came up, explaining their age, wellbeing, faction, name, where they work and where they live. It would also make the camera follow that person. Sometimes, I would find myself just seeing people go about their daily lives for hours on end.+In the population, there are structured families;A little more of a unnecessary part of the game, (but undoubtedly cool) was the structured families. Sometimes when checking people's profiles, you may find a group of people with the same last name. At first, I thought ths was just due to the developers not putting enough names in. But then, I executed a guy, and then everybody with the same last name as him got enraged. Confused, I looked at the effects of executing someone, and it said; ""victim's family will become enraged"" and thats when I realised, there was families, which is really cool!+A system where technology evolves with time;Much like Civilization V (which is an utterly fantastic strategy game), technology would advance as time goes on. This means, that I might start out with some crappy tenements, but when I research more stuff, I could have super high-tec shopping malls. Nuff said.+The ability of extreme POWER;In this game, you have the power of anything and everything on the island, (apart from the rebels, which we will get to later). None of the decisions will be made for you, you have to make them. There are recomendations for what to build, but I mostly found myself ignoring them, as sometimes they can screw you over.+Rebels;The rebels system in this game is rather good. It's simple, when someone becomes too unhappy with the island, they will become a rebel. Rebels can and will screw you over. They will start fires, attack buildings and people and generally become out of control.+Disasters;Perhaps copying other citybuilders, this game has disasters. Dont worry though, you won't be having meteors or aliens or...dinosaurs *cough*Simcity*cough*. Just normal things like nuclear bombs or volcano eruptions or earthquakes. And it won't just be mildly annoying either, it will seriously screw you over. Once, when I built my city next to a volcano, thinking it would look pretty cool, lets just say it wasn't cool when flying blobs of lava engulfed the city and I went financialy in debt.So, thats the list of things which I think are pretty cool in this game. Now, we will talk about the cons.Cons-Limited time;The thing I can think of straight off the bat is that it has a limited amount of time for a game, even in sandbox mode! Sure it is a while, but one time, I built a really great city...and then I couldn't play anymore because my ""mandate had run out"", and that was on maximum time. Sure, it adds realism, but sometimes fun should overweigh how realistic it is. This is where Just Cause 2 shined, now you might be thinking, ""what the devil, what on Earth has that got ot do with Tropico?!"" well, my friend; nothing. I was just bringing it up. Anyways, the reason Just Cause 2 was so fun is that it was completely unrealistic. Tropico should get some inspiration off that.-Lack of help;One of the annoying things about this game is that it just throws you in with ""build a city"". This is a large downside, as the game is quite complicated in the financial part of things. Alot of the time, I found myself looking at my amount of money, going down by the thousands, completely confused why.-Graphics;Now, I would like to point out that this is a very small and minor problem, especially considering it's a citybuilder. But the graphics are a little lacking.Final VerdictSo, we are down to the final verdict, and, if you couldn't already tell with the big blue thumbs up stamped on, I most certainly recomend Tropico 4! Even though it has flaws, I can still say this is a great, solid citybuilder. Thank you for taking some time to read this!",2015,2

Last Light's main attraction, the campaign, holds an uneven tale that varies from clichéd to thrilling, but it chiefly favours the middle ground of these two. The first half to 3 quarters of the story lacks the startling originality and intense, desolate air 2033 portrayed to remarkable effects; but with the gritty and grimy ambiance used as a crutch, Last Light stays above water and carries the player through with few articulate qualms save the dated AI and unabashed exposition present in almost every encounter. It is when we reach the final act in Last Light that things begin to crack and crumble. A rushed conclusion pooled with little climax creates a palpable sense of disheartenment, as if our long, winding journey towards this heavily anticipated finale was a waste of time. Alas, this disappointment is what I ultimately walked away from Last Light with; a spasmodically engrossing but stilted phase in the Metro series. Gunplay and environments are barely worth mentioning as they follow the same archetypal structure of their predecessor, but with slightly improved graphics caked over the top. The main resonating feature in Last Light is sadly displeasure -- but then again, it would be a miracle for this game to even come close to the staggering uniqueness and darkness that Metro 2033 was best known for.6.5/10(I'm only recommending this because a thumbs down is a bit too harsh.)",2014,2

The game features a solid, enjoyable campaign that visits varied locations and harnesses an abundant range of weapons which raise the quality of what could otherwise be a stereotypical, conventional and ultimately dull set of missions. Movements and gunplay is fairly smooth and rarely descends into frustrating territory. Locations pop with colour and life, and there's a bona-fide sense of realism present throughout the environment, even when the mission you are completing is anything but. The real highlight and the most popular aspect of Bad Company 2 is the immensely popular multi-player mode. With it's vast maps, unique and diverse arsenal of weapons and great team mechanics, Bad Company 2's multi-player triumphs over its counterpart and frequently compared franchise Call of Duty in many respects. Teams feel more close-knit and dependant on each other than most other multi-player games and locations feel more expansive too. Moments of tension and anticipation, speculating what your opponents will attempt next are nail bitingly pleasant. Making tactical decisions and planning your movements requires more brain-power and strategizing than what may be expected, but when your plan achieves success, the feeling of jubilation is unmatched. It really is a game mode most enjoyed with friends who enjoy planning out their moves and attempting to execute them with precision. And with an addictive levelling up system, you'll find it hard to pull yourself away.Bad Company 2 is a great game and is a genuine classic in the shooter genre. With it's gradually decreasing popularity thanks to the newer instalments in the Battlefield franchise, it's a smart idea to purchase this while the game's community is still thriving. 8.5/10(Written a while ago)",2015,2

Due to the randomly-generated nature of everything, no two playthroughs are the same, meaning you will never get bored with this game, just extremely frustrated at times (pesky missiles).Yet, this is still one of my favourite games even 2 years after launch, the soundtrack is amazing, the gameplay is outstanding, and the thoughtfulness and visual design is out-of-this-world!

Playing this game is like taking yoga for 5 years, training mercilessly day and night. Then finally surgically removing a rib in order to one day suck your own ♥♥♥♥, only to discover that the relentless physical torment has left your junk in a hapless defective state. What you will experience from playing this game is 99.9% flaming, scapegoating and being killed by players more invested in this video game experience than you could ever hope to be. The majority of mechanical game-play consists of attacking an AI-controlled unit at the last possible moment in order to obtain a pitiful amount of gold from it. And then proceeding to repeat this action hundreds of times every single game. Still interested? I will not question what may be wrong with you but seeing as you have read thus far I will let you in to this little secret. The reason why people have played this game since it's inception, and have never gotten bored of it. This is the little .1% of pure untampered ecstasy. It is the moment that the scales fall from your eyes to reveal the next level of complexity within the world of dota you once believed to be much simpler. The moment you first overcome your opponent with skill you have sacrificed your blood, sweat and tears to develop. When the stars align and that wombo combo aces the 5 ♥♥♥♥boys stupid enough to challenge you and your brothers in arms. When you comeback from mega creeps (A checkmate in nearly all cases) to snatch the victory which dangled so precariously in the jaws of defeat.

The writing. It was really good. Characters were believable and likeable. The dialogue conveyed what was meant to be brought across. The visuals. The game looked nice. I'm somewhat a fan of the style used here, and the backrounds looked great.The story. Without giving away too much, it follows a upstart SC2 player who travels to South Korea in hopes of making it big in the pro-gaming scene. It was really interesting, and I found myself invested in what it told. One complaint though is that it was over a bit fast, and the ending leaves a bit to be desired.

I had just recently come from Call Of Duty on the good old PS3. I couldn't aim down sights, I couldn't run and gun, I didn't know how to control recoil and I had no idea what callouts to say. Since I was useless at Competitive, I played deathmatch (COD influenced me into playing dm) where I was continuously shot from all different angles and was struggling to have a 0.5 KD. My first 90 hours only had a few Competitive games thrown in where I managed to win 1 of them. However, on the holidays my friends would mainly play CS:GO and I joined in. This time was when I began to appreciate CS:GO as an amazing game. It has so many features that many games simply do not have. CS:GO also has a thriving community with millions of people playing every month. There's also the market. There are so many weapon skins available. This game has become one of my favourite games. However, there are some things that aren't necessarily bad, but some people may not like them.

Infantry, Tank Crewman, Pilot, Paratrooper and Recon. You start off as an Infantry soldier and as you level up you can decide to transfer to a different type of soldier.But, the three best things in the game are riding around in the massive maps on a civilian bicycle while ringing the bell or roadkilling pesky German troops while in an APC or combining those with friends.This is a great game and I can't wait until the next update and the release of the final game!

As much as I wish to appraise this game, it cannot deserve a recommendation by me, the fact that you are so unforgivingly banned from matchmaking is pointless to say the least. I was disconnected due to internet hiccups for exactly 3 minutes and 24 seconds (Yes I timed it) and it gives me a 7 day ban. The thing that makes this so frustrating is that, it was the first match back after ANOTHER 7 day ban for similar issues. The fact that they do not forgive the fact that you may live in a woodland area where power can go out every now and again, or the fact that Steam can act buggy sometimes gets it a 3/10 from this CS veteran.2/15/15 Edit: I recieved yet another ban from matchmaking, this times issue was the following; I kicked too many teammates. Let me begin by reiterating that I had just finally gotten back after 2 weeks of no playtime due to internet issues and in this first game, a teammate began to throw the match, I.E. shooting teammates, or shooting in the air around enemies. Yes, someone (Not me) called a vote to kick him and I agreed because he's throwing the match, but appearantly in 2 weeks of no matchmaking play, one vote to kick got me ANOTHER 7 day ban. This is a continued portrayal to CS:GO's broken economy and has dropped my rating to 0/10, how can a game be rated greatly when it prevents all access to competetive players even when there's a fallacy involved?3/13/15 Edit: Another ban to add to this list; this time it's from being kicked too many times, giving me another 7 day, and here's how it happened. The game was a Comp. Office; the CT was whooping our asses so far, yet with me being second top on our team, three of the players who were in a team decided to kick me, because they cannot win. This further proves my thesis that CS:GO is still broken majorly when it comes to matchmaking bans; the utter fact that this game has the audasity (Phonics FTW) to allow things like this to keep happening with no way of appealing to anyone about getting it lifted.",2015,2

I've installed and uninstalled it repeatedly, trying to get into it. There are SO many good ideas in here, but it's just TERRIBLY executed.Tile yields for cities seem to be completely random, with no bearing on the type of tile or any kind of visual cues to clue you in. You can't check what status effect icons mean in battle, which wouldn't be too bad except that each icon can mean multiple things, so good luck with that. Haven't been able to find a way to check a unit's range in a fight, either.It's a shame, because I love the way the overworld drops into the fights, which gives a double layer of strategy, plus the use of outposts to grab resources without having to start a whole new city if there's one spot you want to grab is something a lot Turn Based games could learn from.This is a perfect example that just having great ideas doesn't necessarily translate into a good finished product.

With these randomly generated levels, the designers also placed over 20 bosses that get more and more challenging as you progress and strategies may need to be employed to bring them down. But it doesn't stop there, there are close to 100 items that you can collect which alters the game mechanics and even your characters appearance, and that's not even including DLC. With every game there are the negatives and we must discuss them, so what's wrong with this game? Well the first 10-20 hours will kick you in the ♥♥♥. You will die many, many times and if you don't learn from these mistakes and adapt to an enemies fighting capability you will keep getting your ♥♥♥ kicked. Also be prepared to open up a wiki because when you pickup an item for the first time, there is no telling what it will initially do. However if you can manage to have the patience to get over that first 10-20 hour hurdle, then the game will be a blast.Too long didn't read, let me summarise:                   **Positives**                                                                                                         +Randomly generated levels                                                                     +No two runs will be the same                                                                    +Tons of unique bosses items and enemies (also mini bosses)               +Comedic tone and references throughout game                    **Negatives**-Almost sadistic first 10-20 hours-No item descriptions/ blandly tells you item functions (WTF!?)-Almost unplayable without consulting the WikiThis game is undoughtably fun, don't let those negatives throw you off, this game deserves to be played. I payed $10 for this game, and Iv'e probably milked about 5 times it's value out of it. For $5 on Steam + $3 DLC (that you should only buy once you've completed the game several times) this game is a bargain and deserves your utmost attention.**9/10**",2013,0

Every level is well designed and adds a great sense of immersion to it, they feel genuine and there are many hidden secrets such as apples being hidden in a house with no doors.Finally this game conveys a deep message that is a problem at the core of society, it teaches us that robbing other peoples water and leaving to them is justified as you must save your father.

This game is also based on the creepy pasta character slender, if you didn't already figure that out, but this game changes it up so that he is not always behind you zipping around, but i won't spoil the actual mechanics because they are quite fun to play around with.Unfortunately this game does not handle well on weaker pc's so some people will not be able to see the marvel of the graphics, which in my opinion is some of the best i have ever seen in any horror game, second only to their original slender game- ""Haunt: the Real Slender game"". Also this is a free game, yesFREE GAME!Although it is still in its alpha/beta form so it may not be on final release so I suggest you get it while you can. Also you are only able to play the first episode: ""Haunt"", but episode 2: ""Welcome Home"", to my understanding,, will be available for purchase (sort of like the walking dead game, where you pay for each episode) in the near future.So I am looking forward to buying all the parts but i have yet to finish the first episode because i keep dying from slender man or the various glitches in the game (keep in mind it is still in alpha/beta) such as falling thought the world.I recommend you try out this game whilst it is free to see if you like it, but in my opinion it has a great atmosphere that i think not many recent horror games have been able to achieve for quite some time and i really enjoy playing it.",2013,2

Some reviews below claim to get only 25-30 fps on singleplayer, so I still think this is the most computer intensive game I own. (Although, some speech is prone to muting itself randomly, so that's something you'll have to deal with)One deal breaker for a lot of people though: It requires Uplay - and thus, the Internet - meaning that trying to play it in offline mode is pointless and trying to play it without signing in to Uplay is pointless, even though the servers for this game aren't supported.

It will become Free To Play at around the end of the year. Also, a lot of the negative reviews on the front page are complaining about issues that have been fixed or changed or complaining about features that are not in the game YET.In my opinion, This game has a lot of potential. Even though it is currently in early access, it feels like it has enough replayibility to keep me going for hundreds of hours with the latest update. Now, here are some of the pros and cons for the game in its current state.Some Pros: + Pretty art design, the way it is done gives the game a more 'Toon' feel to it. + Alot more enemy diversity compared to DD1.  + The Game is regularly updated, with the latest patch adding loads of content in to the game. + The people who work on the game interact with the community and hold Developer streams on Twitch every friday. + According to the developers, There won't be DLC Map packs, so the community won't be split. + The music in the game is good. + The towers have more 'Personality' as i would call it... + Once it goes F2P, It won't be P2W. + Betsy and cute Propellor Cats + If you do buy Early Access, you get $30 worth of ingame currency to buy costumes with.A few Cons: - It's in early access, so you have to pay to be able to play it. - Tavern is laggy and the game feels slightly unoptimized. - Uber Skill Spheres cost waaaaaaay too many Wyvern Tokens.. (i call the tokens 'Betsy Bucks') - Level cap that does not take long to reach. (Level Cap will be increased later on) - Earlier maps become meaningless to play once you hit level 25. (They are adding Incursions soon for them to make them playable in late game again) - Bug paradise - No controller support yet.Note: Most of the problems i have with the game a due to the game still being in development and a lot of the features are not in it yet.Final Verdict: While the game is unfinished and has it's fair share of problems, it's fun, which is what people really look for in games. 8/10 (in it's current state)",2015,2

Personaly i find it easier to make and use a car but everybody is better at others. The creating is at first person view which makes it quite easy to create your robots. You can buy more items to create your robot in the store. Once you are done you have 2 options; Battle or Practice. Practice is a mode where you can freely use your robot around a well disigned map. Their are all three combinations of robots you can battle to test your robots power with its guns.

The story is emotional and believable and the games missions are easy to understand with a few well made action set-pieces that didn't feel gimmiky. The mechanics feel up to scratch and the weapons a varied as you use different weapons for different playstyles as you are presented with them along the way.

The labour points is a necessary evil as it stops the economy from being flooded by useless items at launch as so many games have. Its graphics are quite good but are bound to get better as it goes into open stateThe classes are fun and chaotic. Many build have no chance of working while some require a little tweaking to work.

There is no other game in the entire universe, from now until the end of time that will compare to the greatness that is this game.You may say to yourself ""My my, this is a big claim you're making. Exactly what is it about this game that makes it so great?"". Well, let me tell you a story.Back when I was 11 years old, I was at school (bear in mind it was a rural area too, so there was lots of fields and farm animals around). I was in class, staring out the window, distracting myself from the boring lessons I had to endure. Sometimes, I would stare out into the fields and sky, contemplating what it would feel like to be out there, totally free to run around as a goat. I often pretended I was a goat at home, when I was alone in my beadroom, running around in circles destroying all of my toys, video games and things in my closet. This felt like it was representing the urge to release myself from the house I was living in and roam around in nature with all the other animals.For about 10 years since then, I was told to suppress my urge to become a goat. My parents didn't want to continuously purchase new toys and games for me to play with (which in hindsight was fair enough too, considering they would break every time I acted like a goat), and during that time, I felt alone. No one was around to understand how I felt. The urge to run around completely naked as a goat, breaking everything, was all but a distant memory, a shadow of my former self that I regretted to have. For a time, I nearly forgot about doing it at all.That was until this game came along.I played it, and played and played it. It changed by life. All the old feelings and urges came flooding back to me as soon as I started licking cars as they drive by. The wrecking of people's houses reminding me of those times as a kid when I would do the same thing in my bedroom. It felt like the developers truly understood how I feel, after all these years searching for someone who had the same hopes and dreams as me.As a result of playing this game, I have now started organizing meetups at night for likeminded people, and we run on all fours throughout the night, around the fields near my old school amongst other goats. Luckily we can get away with making goat noises when we're surrounded by them. No one seems to notice, thankfully. I hope, at one point, we can run through our nearest city as goats at some point, even if it's in goat costumes.And that is why I think this is the greatest game of all time. If anyone at Coffee Stain Studios reads this, I am personally thanking you for becoming an inspiration for me to create the new 'Goaty' fandom.Sincerely,Bob",2014,2

This is one of the best factors of this game, with a quirky piano solo in the backround which suddenly escalates as you alert security. The storyline is also exellent as you play the roles of many different characters, each with their own funny personality. As you play through the campain, the story develops and twists and creates great suspence and enjoyment.

When I first heard about Fallout 4 coming out I was ecstatic. Every new trailer and press release brought me so much joy. I waited for quite some time for it to come out, and when it did I was glued to it. The intro to the game was amazing; incredibly detailed, lots of beautiful assets where made ( many of which were only used in this intro) and the robot even says your name, how fun. The proceeding 10 or so hours are quite fun and engaging, as most Bethesda games are. It's heavily scripted, you meet lots of new characters and it's a good challenge. You get intoduced to crafting settlements, which can be a nice distraction from the main game but it is by no means nessesary in a game like this. It's a mechanic that's thinly veiled as a fun new feature but it's obvious that Bethesda wanted to tap into the niche Minecraft 'craft anything you want' market.Eventually the game decides it's done chaperoning and you will find that you can make your own choices about how you play the game. I found that this lack of direction or urgency made me fairly slow. I just kind of walked around, looking at things, for over 200 hours. And believe me, when you play for 200 hours the shine wears off. You notice the many imperfections in the game. I grew sort of cynical, I resented my companions for their terrible ai, grew impatient at having to wait for computers to open doors and everything just kind of became a blur.Don't even get me started on the ending. No spoiler warnings but you can definetly tell that the developers only spent time of the things you'd see at E3. Not a lot of thought or time was put into the things that you actually work for, and it's a pretty big letdown, I'm not going to lie.I suppose because I'm such a big fan of the franchise, and because I can look past certain discrepancies, I was able to endure the 200+ hours of gameplay and 100% the achievments. But should a game be endured? Shoudln't I be having fun all the way through? Well to do that, the developers would have needed a lot more time.In conclusion, I would compare Fallout 4 to a 20 ounce steak; the menu made it look so appetising, and the first few bites are delicious, but as you keep going you begin to realise that there isn't going to much change of flavour, and you've got 17 ounces to go. In the end you sit there, exhausted, wondering if it was worth the effort.TL;DR ~ read the first line",2015,2

It wraps up the story of the haunted animatronics, sorta. Its not too bad, but I don't think its very good either. I was a fan of the original. I thought it was a fun yet simple little horror game with a great style. I found the original and its sequel rather tense and scary. This one however, isn't scary. Its tense as hell but I wouldn't call its ""jumpscares"", jumpscares. The original 2 had its animatronics jumping over our desk, right at us. In FNaF 3 the one and only real animatronic (and even calling him an animatronic is a stretch) Springtrap leans in while opening his mouth, as if too say ""gotcha again! Wanna go another round??"" The closest we get to jumpscares are our old friends returing in hallucinations. But their jumpscares become predictable and will only scare you once or twice. Gameplay is what we've come to expect from the Five Nights series. Monitor the cameras, don't let the oogley boogleys get you. The no doors mechanic from the second game is still here, (again) sorta. Instead of a door into your office, you have a vent system under the main map with grates you can close. There are now multiple ways for our furry friend Springtrap to tell us to restart the game. It can be very tense, not knowing where hes coming from, but I still don't find the ""jumpscare"" scary. From door or vent, Springtrap fails to delight. There are secrets aplenty in this game, also multiple endings. Not much replay value though. I've made it past night 2 in this one (look at my reviews of FNaF and FNaF 2) but have since gotten bored and frustrated due to difficulty spikes in the 3rd night. I do recommend this game, just. Its an alright game, not scary but alright. Lets all hope that Five Nights at Freddy's 4 is good. Because from the looks of it, it's going to be what I've wanted since the original.ADDITIONAL NOTES: Scott Cawthon can be forgiven for Springtrap not having scary jumpscares, as he was using a new graphics enging while making the 3rd entry. I forgot to mention this. The 4th game will run on a simillar engine and has a longer development time than the first 3 and the jumpscares, animatronics and theme all look they'll make for good horror. I hope to get the 4th game day of release (as I've been doing since the 2nd game) because I must be honest, I kinda want to spend another Five Nights at Freddy's one last time.",2015,0

While I find this game to be fun, it gets old very quickly. Nazi Zombies have been done to death at this point, the objectives are all the same and some missions are almost damn impossible on single player. It might be better with friends but I haven't played co-op so I wouldn't know. Hardly any sniping as you're always getting attack by hordes of Zombies. You can snipe a few but I always end up pulling out my machine gun and mowing them done that way instead. The graphics are the same as V2, aside fro everything being a lot darker. Boss fights are okay but again get old fast because the boss you're fighting decides to spawn a horde on you. Not much variety when it comes to enemies. You have standard Zombies, running kamikaze grenade zombies, big zombies with machine guns and jumping sniper zombies. You get all the guns from V2 straight away (except for some reason they're missing a few it seems) but special weapons can be found out in the feild, but with very little ammo for them. This is one of those times where I wish Steam had a meh button. If you're looking for a zombie shooter, buy Left 4 Dead or L4D2. Its coop and actually very fun. If you're looking for a good sniper game get V2. It is also coop (with 2 players) and very fun. If you just want a brainless (hah) shooter that is good for wasting time with get this I guess.

Keep in mind the last COD game I played was Black Ops 2. This game is fun to muck around with it's cheaper price at the moment I believe it's worth it. So far I've only tried MP and Zombies so i cannot give a review of the story, I don't expect much however.Let's start with the Cons:HUGE FRAME RATE ISSUES - Seriously fix this asap! The lag kills.Latency issues - A few times I think I've been placed on servers that aren't from my regionKillstreaks aren't new - All the killstreaks are basically reskinned from olders, not much new content hereAuto Shotguns - (Do I need to explain this further?)Controls were difficult to change - Issues with sliding and crouching after changing controlsPros:Multiplayer actually feels fresh - (From when I last played atleast)Lots of customization - Guns are customizable, skins, attachments, characters and so on.Jetpack and wall running - Need I say more? Who doesn't love a firefight whilst sprinting along a wall?Zombies looks crazy - I've played a tiny amount, but it seems like there is so much content here.I recommend this game if you're looking for some fun, either alone or with friends. I also advise you to buy it when it's cheap.",2015,0

It feels authentic in a sense that, if you're in a specific level, you're trapped by actual walls or solid and visible objects; as opposed to invisible objects. Some would think that it might have invisible walls with a futuristic touch, like blue lines going through it, since it is a Sci-Fi game.Half-Life 2 also does an excellent job and making you feel scared. There is one level, Ravenholm, it is absolutely filled with zombies, it is a very dark and eerie level. I remember, the entire time I was playing through it, I was extremely terrified, but had to power through. It was hard.Half-Life 2's combat is pretty spot on, almost no errors anywhere with hitboxes being fine and no noticeable or game-breaking bugs. The game also has a variety of weapons.Half-Life 2 lets you drive 2 vehicles in the game, one of which is a Jeep, it is a very fast land-vehicle. It is mildly difficult to control while at high speeds, which isn't a bad thing, it's to be expected. The Airboat is a fast land and water vehicle which is noticeably difficult to control, at almost any time. The game has a good sue of vehicles in specific levels.Half-Life 2's soundtrack and sounds do sound very modern. The soundtrack is extremely good, and chooses what to play at specific times, but even so, the music it does actually play is very good. Even now, while writing this review, I am listening to part of the soundtrack, Triage at Dawn, it is called. A very, very nice part of the soundtrack. The sounds, even crowbarring a toilet or a wall, do sound very real.The game, I should talk about, doesn't, for me, at least, do an excellent job at keeping you hooked, it took me a while in between play-sessions to get back into it. But I very recently finished it.This all makes out to be a very pleasant gaming experience, and it is highly recommended as a game.91/100",2014,2

This game is surprising relaxing, casual and amazing experience to play. Got a spare 5 mins before work, school, or even football training? Just launch Floating Point. Playing this game for ten minutes feels like 30, and it is all so rewarding when you can swing yourself across the level at a hundred miles per hour and get that last beam of light to unlock all the traces of where you have been. Once you complete a level and press enter you transfor yourself, a little ball thing, into the background of the previous level. The music is so relaxing and vibrant, and I love how the sound of it gets ""distorted"" when you go under water. When you go under water you lose a lot of momentum and it's a lot harder to get in the water then above the water. Another thing about the water is that you float in it, so it's very hard to get far enough to get those deep level beams of light you need to travel through. The aim of the game is to pretty much fly through these red beams of light (which also get shorter if you hit a wall) and progress through many levels.In all this is a MUST download (as it's a free game), so what are you waiting for? It's only about 54 MB and it's free! Get it before they put a pricetag on this wonderful creation of a game! =D",2014,2

Not to mention living, for a living.This game was a bit complicated when you first pick it up, especially without a friend to help you out with some neat old tips, but it's easy to get into after a little bit. In this game there are three vanilla (not including moded zombies like hellsgate map explosive zombies XD), Runners, Walkers and Kiddies. Be weary of kids, though small, consider them a zombie version of a ninja assassion. Small and fast. There are Runners which will sprint at you and grapple you unless you push em away with v. same with walkers but they dont sprint. Oh and theres the player zombies from fallen infected comrades which are slightly tougher thern the runners. As you just heard, if you get grappled you will get bitten by a zombie and may even get infected unless you quickly shoot/kill it or push it away. There are also the many many guns and weapons you can use, including the badass grenades, molotovs and tnt's. The ammo management is quite complex compared to things like cod where only certain guns can take certain ammo. E.g. a winchester rifle uses 357. ammo as does the S&W so if you expect it to be like cod zombies this is not what your looking for.With that aside I have had a lot of laughs and many fun hours with this game with my friends. There is an endless amount of fun you can have with this game in general, and I hope this review gave yall mates a breif idea of what this game is like! ;)",2014,0

I am 36 hours in to the game and I am far from finishing in any way shape or form. The game has issues that some mods can fix, such as the controversial dialogue wheel, or the fact that the ground is so low res it looks like Fallout 3 at times. The game also almost forces you into being the Hero, and there is almost no option to be the villian, for example in Fallout 3, within the first twenty minutes of the game you can nuke an entire city. The dialogue can trick you into thinking that you are being ""evil"" but really your just saying something like a ♥♥♥♥ instead of like a nice guy. But if you can look past these flaws, the game tells an excellent narative, it gives you a constant itch to continue playing or pick it up again, because of the amount of content the game holds.

While it is a great game overall, it does have its flaws. The game requires a lot of grinding, so if you aren't a fan of that, you won't like it in this. The plot is generic compared to modern games, but since it was originally made for an 8 bit system in 1990, it's excusable. Unlike every game since IV (and the remakes of I and II), each level of magic has it's own MP level, and each one gains new MP individually. This means that when you get spells of a new magic level, you can only use them once or twice before healing, but you can get more MP with levels. However, the game has its good features. It was the first game to feature the Job system, which returned in later games like V and XIV: ARR. With this, you can change your characters classes freely, at any time. It was also the first game to feature summons, and has many of the classics, like Bahamut, Ifrit and Odin. It has good graphics and a good soundtrack.

It's not a counter strike clone since when in counter strike can you hold 3 primary weapons and put scopes on them and modify them with silencers and other attachments and you cannot dual wield weapons in counter strike. This game has a nutshot kill no other FPS game i have played has that it's funny to shoot someone in the nuts. If you don't have good gear and can't compete with the players who paid just play on the noob servers or play a mode like fireteam were you all work together to win and not fight aganst each other.,2013,2

Battle can be rather repetitive after a while, luckily after levelling up a bit you get certain attacks that can decimate large groups of enemies (Black Fang, Howling Bullet, etc) but you need CP charged up but that doesn't take too long.

But don't even try if you cannot play this with a controller.   Dark Souls is tremendously challenging yet with the challenge comes the single most rewarding experience in any game. It is designed to allow you to play the game repeatedly (a feature I have never enjoyed in previous games but is perfect here), with different character builds. Verying builds change the game so much that you could keep playing it almost indefinitely without running out of something unique to experience and it is in these secondary, tertiary and further playthroughs where this game shines brighter than ever. Being able to carve your way through the bosses who previously had you stumped for days is an incredible feeling and reflects your skill progression. And that's the thing: This game is toted as being incredible hard (and I cannot deny that it is at times) but at the same time, it makes you so skilled at it that what was once impassable becomes easy (so long as you don't drop your guard!). You are given the tools to become incredibly skilled and your skill will make you feel better than in any other game.   It stands up as one of the most graphically beautiful games I have ever seen, complimented by a beautifully imaginative art style and character design.   Combat is absolutely perfect and controls are so tight that you will never feel cheated when you die; it can only ever be your fault ;).   The multiplayer isn't to be ignored and offers a tremendous amount of enjoyment for those brave enough to give it a shot.   The story is as deep as you choose to delve. If you don't care for it, you can ignore it completely and have a great time but buried within is some of the most intriguing lore you could ever find, if you dare look for it (look at youtube user VaatiVidya for more).   All this said, some elements of the port to PC aren't so great. *IMPORTANT* Don't even try if you don't have a controller to play this with. And DS suffers from some serious display issues which make the game unplayable for me, without the use of the mod DSfix (Seen here: http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/?tag=dsfix).   Despite some issues (which can easily be fixed) this is the single greatest game I have ever played and I cannot recommend it more to anyone who has a controller and the determination to take arms against this tremendous challenge.",2013,2

Role playing as the ever gloomy but always badass Witcher Garalt, the wide open worlds for you to explore just provides hours of gameplay, not only for exploring but completing quests and finding gear to build Garalt’s armour and craft new weapons. The Witcher 3 is so immersive and just dripping with atmosphere accompanied by incredible voice acting and an amazing soundtrack to boot. The combat is brutal and rewarding for lovers of hack and slash games and really captures the heart of combat, especially when you are face to face with a hideous vampire or terrifying griffin. Fighting groups of gang members, heavily armed guardsmen or an army of nekkers, it just feel ♥♥♥♥ing great to combine the skills of alchemy and magic as well as sword play to annihilate whatever foe poses threat to you. The plot line is incredibly well written and the voice actors capture their roles perfectly, leaving you in aw every time you engage conversation. Side quests are just as interesting as the main story line, with each area having its own interesting law and characters who create a living, breathing environment that keep you swinging your sword and flapping your lips for hours and hours. Combining combat skills with magic and alchemy allow you as a player to experiments and discover new ways to combat your enemies and with preparation of potions and oils, can turn the tides of any battle.

The Graphical standards are outstanding and leave you with a boner every time you start up the game. CD Project Red seriously put the time and effort into this game and it shows with all the little intricate details and even just simple things that other RPGs just don’t do, and it’s a real treat for players. You will more than get your money’s worth with this game, it goes beyond common RPG titles and puts come of this year’s releases to shame really. When you think of the price of this game and the amount of hours of gameplay, fun and involvement you will get out of it, ♥♥♥♥♥ all over whatever $80 of $90 FPS you think is cool but actually only has 6 to 10 hours of campaign and a few hours of multiplayer till next reskin in a years’ time.

I know why you’re here… because you heard that The Witcher 3 Was epic and you wanted to know a fellow Gamers opinion. Well here it is… The Witcher 3 is an amazing game, a clear step above most if not all RPGs now days. It’s a gorgeous and immersive story that will entertain you for hours and hours with its amazing sword play, great voice acting, well written story and… boobs… yeah there are boobs. 10/10 Keep it up CD Project Red, let this be a benchmark for Cyberpunk!

The story, writing and gameplay from the original game are back, with some new cast members to either be eaten or saved. That's about as good as it gets, however, because (especially in the second half of the game) the developers seem to have forgotten what made the first one so good.The game is as brutal as the first, but without purpose. In the first one, characters died as a result of your failure to protect them. In this one, people die because the developers said so, and because they want to show how 'dramatic' they can be, forgetting that the key point of drama is audience involvement.The game allows you to brood for ages about whether to reconnect with your old friends, or what to do when your plans fail, and then it'll pull out of nowhere a choice that you can't possibly be prepared for. I remember one particular section in which you have to help one of two endangered allies, but both choices led to the same outcome!I don't want to say that it's all bad.

There were the good players, the bad ones, and the experts. However, there was one thing Gabe instructed them not to do ever. They were to never boast about ones skills or hats. All was well. Until one day. A simple child, ignorant of the rule, began boasting. He told tales of his ""quick scopes"" and his ""360 no-scope"". Gabe heard all of this, and took action. He turned the boastful child into a something that would be detested and looked down upon forever. The ghostly gibus. Afterwards, he unleashed the gates of hell, freeing those he knew would corrupt the game. The scammers, the small children, the idlers and the call of duty fan boys. With this, he retreated back to Valve, a symbol of happiness, and promised more hats and weapons.

Personally, I just thought the game was mediocre.The gameplay is nothing really that special, it's a first person shooter, and a very simple one at that. I do like the range of weapons, from pistols to rifles to shotguns, and you can carry them all at one, so there is a lot of variety, much like Bioshock. However, the puzzles are extermely straight forward and the vehicles are so finicky, I press the D key for a millisecond and the entire boat goes in a 90 degree angle, the gameplay was just simple and nothing special. It just got boring for me in the end.The graphics weren't bad, for 2004 they look quite good, but to today's standards, they are a bit outdated to today's standard's like Infamous Second Son and the new Wolfenstein. Also I didn't care for the story or the character's for that matter, especially Gordon Freeman. He is possibly one of the boring video game protagonist. He is basically just there as a object of plot, he could be more intersting if we actually heard him speak, but he is just boring. People say that he is like Link from the Legend of Zelda, but the thing with Link is you can see his facial expreesions and see how he is feeling, making him more developed, Freeman is blank with no word of dialouge and no face in game. He is not a charactter, he is an object.Personally, I don't like this game, because of the high critical acclaim it got, and it had a very sour payoff.

I found the story in the beginning a bit slow and uneventful, but the bright and glamorous world made up for that with interesting dialogue, spoken by the people lining the streets and the great showcase of the indoctrination of the people by Father Comstock. As the story/game progresses things change dramatically, throwing in plenty of combat and spicing up the story perfectly.After ruthlessly slaughtering countless numbers of enemies I found the combat got a bit dull, and in a way a bit easy after getting most of the upgrades and new weapons/vigors. The enemies are also a bit on the bland side, since most of them are just a darkish colour and little detail on the uniforms I found my self killing what I thought was the same person over and over again, this was especially prevalent towards the end of the game.The combat incorperates a lot of 'fantasy' into it, with things like Vigors and more modern guns with a little less realism and less punch. The physics of the weapons felt great too, they were not way too unrealistic but they weren't too reaslistic either, which provided a nice blend making those heads look as bigger target as always. If I were to have 1 major complaint about the guns it would be how underpowered some guns can be towards the end of the game, where I ran out of ammo for  my sniper and had only a pistol as a replacement. The pistol been my main weapon at the beginning of the game and could take down enemies in what felt like 1 blow, but the pistol had no such effect when taking down the same enemies later on, making one have to completely spray all their ammo at the opponents head to actually take them down.At the end of the story things get very weird and confusing but when the game ends, most previous events in the game begin to come together, but some do not leading to a lot of confusion and possibly sequels (?). The end left me wanting to play again, so that I can find all those little events that link to the main plot and then giggle, thinking about ""how could I have not noticed this before?""This game is one of a small ammount of games that have left me happy and satisfied at the end, and I can definately see myself playing it again sometime in the future. To get a game this great for only $10 was itself amazing. I have seen games that cost a lot more and has been realeased a lot earlier, that are absolutely terrible. Overall I believe Bioshock Infinite to be well worth the time and money, and that Irration games & 2K have done an exellent job, creating what is probably, a masterpiece. I would definately recommend getting this game, and I guarantee (A guarantee? Who has time for all that paperwork?)  you will have fun!  I give it a 10/10",2014,2

The way in which the story grips you, the way you relate to the protagonist, the way the small town the game is set in is always alive, the... Well, just everything about this game sets it apart from the rest of the market today. The story of Deadly Premonition centres around FBI agent Francis York Morgan who is sent to the small rural town of Greenvale to investigate the tragic and mysterious death of a young girl, Anna Graham. Upon nearing Greenvale, however, he is swerved off the road and comes to in a strange place known as the “other world”. Whilst attempting to make his way out of here, York catches a glimpse of an enigmatic axe-wielding man. Eventually you escape and make your way back towards the town, it is here that the first of the colourful cast are introduced. The sherriff of Greenvale, George Woodman, and his deputy, Emily Wyatt, greet York just outside of town and provide an escort to the hotel, where work on solving this case can finally begin.It is here where the character of Zach is firmly introduced into the game, and the way in which it is done, will grip you for the entirety of the games 26 chapters. The player takes on the eponym of Zach throughout the game and is consistently addressed by York when left alone. When driving, or wandering through town, York gleefully strikes up a discussion about one of many different topics. From childhood memories and music to sharing his encyclopeadic knowledge of the film industry, there is no shortage of dialog in these moments of solitude. As mentioned earlier, however, there is quite a large and colourful cast of characters within Greenvale, each with their own story to tell and each possibly implicated in the murder of Anna Graham. From the effiminate policeman, Thomas MacLain; the potato-chip enthusiast and local doctor, Ushah Johnson or; the travelling sapling salesman, Forrest Kaysen. Each and every resident of Greenvale is memorable for their own reason, and further pulls you into the game and into the role of York. Encounters with these residents are not isolated incidents, as the world of Deadly Premonition is constantly alive. Each person lives out their lives with their own daily routine, oftentimes they can be seen passing you on the streets or hanging out at the local bar, the SWERY '65 (a nod to the developer of the game Hidetaka Suehiro, SWERY for short). As such, every moment in Greenvale feels unique, a feeling that hasn't been represented in gaming since Yu Suzuki's Shenmue for the SEGA Dreamcast in 1992. Most of the residents have their own sidequests attached to them, and the rewards for these greatly assist in completing the game, with new weapons and discount cards being just an example. These sidequests can be creative as well, from assisting Emily in bettering her abilities as a chef; helping Anna's mother deal with her loss or reorganising the store room of the convenience store. Everywhere you go, there will always be something to do or something to see, and there is almost always a benefit to exploring Greenvale. Unfortunately, this is where some of the problems of Deadly Premonition rear their head. The map provided to you can be difficult to use as it faces in the direction that York is facing when you open it. This means that if you were to check the map to see where you are going, then check again to see if you were still on the right track, the map can look completely different. The map can't be rotated once it's open and also can't be zoomed out to a comfortable level, always feeling a little too zoomed in, forcing you to learn the town's layout rather than rely too heavily on the in-game map. The layout of Greenvale isn't the only that you need to keep in the back of your mind, however. Firstly, there is a stamina meter in the game, meaning that running for too long or attacking too many times in succession can cause York to stumble around blindly for a moment whilst he catches his breath. Hunger and tiredness also play a role in the game and can be checked at any point by accessing the pause menu. Food is littered throughout town and the various “other world” levels that you venture through, and therefore isn't much of a problem. Even if you are out of food for whatever reason, there are many places in Greenvale where you can get a meal at a price. As for tiredness, this is replenished through either sleeping at various beds scattered through Greenvale, or by consuming coffee. Lastly, the game has a 24 hour timing system where certain places and events become inaccessible late in the day. You can sleep to fast forward up to 12 hours at a time, however sleeping for too long will cause you to gain hunger and also cause your clothes to need washing (yes, you read that right). The little things that you have the ability to do in the game is a small but interesting detail. Clothes can be washed, your beard can be shaved and we haven't even gotten to the driving yet. Deadly Premonition is a free roam game, but not in the same vein as, say, Saints Row. You have the ability to explore Greenvale freely and it is encouraged to do so, as such York is provided a Master Key to all the police cars in town soon after arriving (though several more cars can be unlocked later into the game). If driving at night, you can use your headlight; rain, use the wipers; need to turn, then indicate. All of these little nuances, on top of everything else mentioned earlier, cements you into the game and makes you feel as though you are York, as though you are the protagonist. A feat which is not easily achieved and one that SWERY should be commended for accomplishing.Though not all is well in Greenvale, and it is still your job to uncover what is going on. Upon progressing through the game, you learn the folklore of the Raincoat Killer. A mysterious figure who, in the 1950's, went on a murderous rampage through Greenvale; a legend that instills fear into even the youngest of its residents, resulting in a town that stands still when it rains. These are the times when York often ends up in the “other world”. These sections are filled with enemies and puzzles that must be overcome before you can return to the normal Greenvale. Hidden within these words are often vital clues to uncovering Anna's tragic death. Often the word “PROFILING” fills the screens whilst York nonchalantly lights a cigarette. This is followed by many  static images that flash before your eyes as you try and piece together what is happening in this small town. As you progress through the “other world”, these images will slowly clear up, allowing York to slowly piece together the events that occurred. Progression through these sections is slowed by a number of zombie-esque enemies known as “Shadows”. These enemies move slowly and are unarmed at first, but soon they will be wielding pitchforks and eventually shotguns. Though they aren't difficult to kill, they often respawn and, as a result, become more of a threat as a mob, rather than when taken individually. To bring them down, York can arm himself with a variety of weapons, including shovels, axes, shotguns and rifles. The combat takes the over-the-shoulder format that was popularised by Resident Evil 4, meaning that you are frozen in place whilst ever you are lining up a shot. This serves to intensify the action sequences, limiting the shots to only those that are essential so as to keep moving and outrun the shadows hunting you down.To further hinder progress, several puzzles lye in the way to solving this case. Though, unfortunately, these are never too tricky, as they are mostly explained upfront and serve more as a motivation to explore these levels rather than to test your ability.Continued...",2014,0

You both raise your rifle. You move to fire. The moments is broken by an artillery shell. You stare at the german seeing his soul. The ground rips around you. You see your hands flying off. the german turns into mist. Everything goes black.This game is amazing an excellent example of a realistic shooter. You don't take a break because you are bored. You take a break because you're emotionally exhausted.,2015,0

(I haven't played rebirth as of this recommendation) I still find myself coming back to this game time and time again due to its replayability with its randomly generated levels/rooms that make every game different and are similar to the first Legend of Zelda's dugeons, where you have to beat every enemy in the room to continue forward. You also collect items on the way either found in rooms with a gold crown on the door, the store, random encounters with certain enemies, secret rooms and even more...also all the items are either  similar or different to each other so it can be quite easy to get an awesome combo to beat your enemies...or a bad combo :beatmeat: you can also get usable items like cards, bombs or books that can either shield you, increase your attack or even make you invincible.

It is one of the only truly realistic hunting game out there. While you have to track your animals down really slowly and quietly it makes for a good game because you are constantly looking around trying to be careful while finding the correct tracks for your animal. The way the guns aim, and work make it harder but more fun.Although you have to pay to hunt in other locations and hunt different animals, it is still fun to hunt those damn White Tails. I can take from 20-200 minutes or even more to kill one animal... if you keep scaring it off which makes for great concentration and learning.

They had a weird balance between being able to interact with some future chapter items, while some not at all, which didn't help me. When the eye icon showed up & I clicked it, for particular things it wouldn't say anything which to me defeats the purpose of putting an eye icon. Needs fixing: I had trouble at chapter 19 because the head statue I was meant to use didn't spawn in the right spot.Recommendations:Chores are great, I was able to get all the gifts in the first 2 chapters.

I really enjoyed both series and have grown to love Killing Floors new take on gameplay such as the removal of Crosshairs and the lack of endless waves like CoD Zombies. The game has 7 classes. Demolitions, Sharpshooter, Commando, Firebug, Field Medic, Support Specialist, and Bezerker. Each class takes a while to level up (A while meaning that it could take a month grinding out a class to the max level of 6.) so if you're a completionist then you can take the time to grind out your classes if thats your thing. The achievement hunters will have a couple hundred achievements to get. Some like the Hell on Earth achievements (Max difficulty achievements) can take a very long time to get due to how difficulty Hell on Earth can be. Simply put, Killing Floor might have a dead playerbase, but if you gather up some friends there's lots of fun to be had.Also.LODESAMONE.",2014,0

The Boomer- Nothing much to explain about him he is a bloated infected who will throw up boomer bile on the survivors attracting a horde to attack them and attractting nearby infected if killed he will explode showering bile on nearby surfaces and survivors their is an item that allows the survivors to use his own bile against him. The Hunter- A hooded teenage looking infected who will leap great distances to catch lone survivors dealling massive damage untill killed or freed can leap from far and high places to deal damage pounces which range around 1 to 25 damage dealling instant damage and is the only infected that does not have to wait for his ability to recharge. The Charger- This infected has a large arm that will smash into survivors knocking other team mates into the air he cannot be bashed off his victim normally having to be killed a Charger may also ram survivors off high places incapping or killing instantly. The Jockey- The Jockey is the only infected that can move their victim around willingly instead of the Chargers ram which cannot be steered as well as the Smokers pull and Hunters pounce The Jockey can be fought against though if the survivor mashs their move buttons making it difficult for the Jockey to move them but they also deal damage much like the others clawing at their victims face untill downed and unable to ride like the Hunter it must pounce to capture someone. The Spitter- Purely a support infected like the Boomer the Spitter can split survivors with her acid spit or can spit on incapped or ""pinned"" survivors spreading panic and killing the survivor quicker making it a valuable asset to the team if used correctly like the Boomer its death has a last act of revenge spreading its acid although smaller on the ground like its spit attack. The Tank- The Tanks the brute force and favorite of most players the Tanks only goal is to spread damage to kill or make a miserable mess of the survivors defences with 3 different attacks like its punch attack which knocks back survivors knocking them senseless for a short amount of time a rock throw attack taking out snipers who aren't willing to take any damage from the behemoth and knocking them down giving the Tank a chance to get close and a car/object punch which sends any car or object flying and immediatly incapping survivors or on rare chances stumbling them or killing them making it very effective at taking out close groups and clusters. The Witch- The Witch is one of the only infected thats avoidable only attacking when disturbed killing and incapping in one hit being startled by flashlights and close survivors.Realism and Realism Versus- Realism is a gamemode of pure teamwork being unable to see someone through walls or being pinned also Witches will kill in one hit Realism Versus is purely the same as Versus defualt just with the added rules of Realism.Survival- Much like the Call of Duty gamemode Zombies but with a twist the survivors are able to equip anything they like before they start the match and instead of rounds its random hordes and Tanks as well as a timer recording how long your team survived 2 alteritive Mutations( We will get to these) are Survival Versus which is Survival with Versus merged and one team sets the time while the other beats it and keeps going till one team does not beat the others time and Hold Out which is like a Hold Out finale but quicker to finish.Scavenge- A quick version of Versus one team must collect gas cans and put them in the generator while the infected team must try and stop them from beating their score the first team to beat their score all added together wins the match.Mutations- Weekly gamemodes like Hunting Party, Last Man On Earth and TAAAANK! that are available on the Steam Workshop along with other community made skins and Campaigns that are remixes of gamemodes or entirely new ones as earlier mentioned Survival Versus is one such gamemode.Now for the conclusion this game has its ups and downs like its prequel but its worth buying the glitchier but funner version on P.C with the custom content and free DLC some players do not like the lack of weapons while most like it cause its simple and means your favorite weapons never too far from reach but what about the gamemodes? are some even worth playing? It is true that Survival and Scavenge are not played as much like Mutations mostly cause most players normally have enough time on their hands to play a full Campaign or Versus match and most of the Mutations that are fun require manual installation or having to be found in the wasteland of the Steam Workshop but this does not mean its not a bad game I rate it 9/10 Cause of its teamwork based gameplay which I have yet to see in many games and plus Valves style of simplicity with simple graphics and not overly complicated gameplayer (I am looking at you Battlefield and Call of Duty) this games a hit and miss some people will like it some will not but I absolutely love it as I have played the first since it came out and loved that even though I was missing alot such as weapons and items and lacking infected varity but its simplistic gameplay style contributes to it so thats my review and have a great day!",2013,2

The game is fun to play in multiplayer, because having friends makes you share your items with others and has to use a lot of cooperation so that all players have things necessary to defend against waves of zombies. when I started to survive in the game, I thought it would be a game like rust, minecraft, terraria, etc.. but I found it different, there are many more things to do and what matters most in this game is the way to be able to have enough things to survive, from when you start to when you finish, the path between the two is as much fun in this game. Never give up on the game as always will have something to help you succeed. the concluion is that it is one of the best games that are survival and is in beta, the game is complete when the probability of finding the most entertaining game that was in beta will be higher.

They even go to as complicated as following a series of mini-quests and dungeons in order to complete the Quest.- HousingNow, the ""Housing"" in Mabinogi is not your usual home-like area.The ""Homestead"" that you own from level 10 onwards, is actually different for everyone depending on their tastes. There are three locations to choose - Human area which is Grasslands, the Elven area which is a Desert, and finally the Giant area which is Snow.While you get to choose your location, when you level your Homestead up (yes, it has levels!) - you can then build more unique structures. Everyone's Homestead will be different.- RacesThere are three Races to choose from, upon your initial character creation.Human. Giant. Elf.Each Race will of course have bonuses and different specialties.For example - Humans are the only ones who can use two swords.Elves are extremely amazing Archers, while the Giants have more Health and Strength, and more powerful 2-handed weapons.- Marriage & FamilyYes, in Mabinogi there is a Marriage system.You can get Married to the opposite Gender, or even the same Gender!As for Family - If you get Married, you can create a Family.A Family can consist of yourself and your partner, and up to 6 Children.There is a Family Rule that can be set (example: No dropping items). It will reeset every week I believe, and it will show a counter for those who break the rule.- Pets / MountsYou can obtain Pets and Mounts in-game.Most of the better ones are from the Cash Shop (NX / Karma Koin).Some pets are simply just that - Pets. Both a Pet and a Mount will have inventory for you to store your items. Mounts on the other hand, can be land-based, or have the ability to fly as well.- Rebirthing""Rebirth"" is something unique this game offers. You can Rebirth every so often up to level 1000 Total, from there onwards you will actually need to Rebirth every week or purchase character cards to use to Rebirth.Rebirthing a character will give you the option to change your character appearance, level, age and even gender!- LevelsThere are two variants of levels in Mabinogi.Your level, which is basically your ""combat"" level. Everything you do will earn you exp, which will contribute to this level.There is also Exploration levels. To level this up, you basically have to do Exploration Quests, or go out into the Wilds in Iria (Elves and Giant area), and search for unique hidden objects and items, which you can trade in for EXP and Gold.To level up anything, you will need AP which can be granted upon every level up.The higher your ranks go in a skill, the more AP it will require to level up.- RanksSkill ranks go from the following order (worst to best)NoviceFEDCBA987654321 - Max RankAnd now, to my favourite part...- Non-Combat SkillsNon-Combat Skills are extremely variable.Want to spend your time Cooking tasty treats? Become a Chef!Feel like crafting your own Clothes? Become a Tailor!Want to laze around and spend your time Fishing? Then do so!There are many non-combat skills to find and master.The one unique one which makes Mabinogi different than other games, is simply my favourite;Musical Instruments & Composing.You can re-create songs inside of Mabinogi.Want to play Skyrim Theme? Done.Want to play Game of Thrones theme tune? Done.Pokemon Battle Theme? Done.If you wish to give it a go and enjoy playing, feel free to play with us.Server: TarlachMy in-game name: Alyxa",2015,2

This makes it one of the best games I have played.The visual graphics aren't the best, however for one of the time period that this game came out in - it is actually quite decent.The atmosphere in the game varies depending on your situation.I would recommend this game if anyone wanted a survival action game to play with others.For those who do not know how to play DayZ:- Install and run Arma 2.- Install and run Arma 2: Operation Arrowhead.- Download and install DayZ commander and then the mods/maps you wish to play.",2014,2

Most ""cans"" of drink are counted as Hunger, not Thirst.- CustomizationThe customization within the game is amazing. Not only can you change the usual things - such as gender and skin colour.You can wear and replace the following; Headpiece, Eye-wear, Shirt, Trousers, Gloves, and Shoes.Besides the clothing customization - you can also find pieces to customize guns with, such as the stock, grip, scopes, etc.- OverallFor an Alpha...

It's very much a bland and by-the-numbers effort of shoehorning the Dead Island series into the inanely grindy free-to-play model that most people are getting sick of these days.The theme is so utterly detached from the mechanics that the game could be about anything.  You do repetitive missions to slowly grind resources and XP so you can build better equipment to keep grinding resources and XP at a higher difficulty.  To emphasise how detached the game's mechanics are from the franchise and theme:The missions see you fighting your way through interesting looking locales littered with all sorts of weapons and items that could be used as such... which are all entirely uninteractive.  As is everything else in the environment other than the zombies.Instead, you do some arbitrary task to gather resource cubes which you return to the start of the level, and after the mission you are rewarded with crafting materials such as duct tape and clothto use for blueprints.You can tell how little thought or imagination has gone into a game when you are forced to walk past assault rifles and rocket launchers to pick up cubes, so that you can craft a plank with nails in it out of duct tape and cloth.  I wish I was exagerrating, but that is literally what you do.There's a ""crossroads"" mission system for PvE where you get 3 randomly selected tasks each time, but within about 3 of these missions you've seen pretty much all there is to see.  None of it is particularly interesting - Go there.  Kill that.  Go there.  Defend that.  Go there.  Pick stuff up.The combat / gameplay itself is... passable.  Nothing particularly interesting or imaginative, and if you're playing with high ping due to not being in NA or EU it feels very slow and unresponsive.There doesn't really seem to be any endgame, or even any meaningful progression - just another grinding treadmill.  A game full of arbitrary limitations and restraints designed to find the lucritive balance between addicting you enough to keep playing and irritating you enough to cough up some dollars.Dull, uninspired, entirely devoid of any originality or charm.",2015,0

There's orbment (i.e. magic) system frustrated me a little - Much of it goes unexplained outside of an in-game manual, and it's quite cumbersome to keep flicking between the manual and the menus to figure out which combinations of orbments will gain you access to which spells.  Around mid-game when I had access to most types of orbments, I slapped a ""good enough"" config into my characters and then never had the incentive or desire to delve back into it other than to replace orbments with higher level ones.Support and defensive orbments/abilities also seemed to be unnecessary throughout the entire game, other than in the final boss battle.  It all just boiled down to damage, damage, damage...What really kept me playing though were the game's story/writing, the music, and the attention to detail.  Unlike many JRPGs, the plot is engaging and coherent and the characters are interesting and relatable.  It's all quite trope-heavy, so don't expect stunning levels of originality - but it's pulled off with enough charm and intrigue to keep you nicely entertained.The music is catchy and pleasant - up there with Final Fantasy at times.  Sound effects are pretty standard / nothing special.  The attention to detail can be seen in the environments (particularly in the towns), enemies, dialog, etc...  It feels like a lot of care has been put into the game.I was happy to sink ~50 hours into it, and would recommend it to JRPG fans.",2015,2

It covers the bases of visuals, sound, writing, voice acting, etc fairly well (although I'm not a fan of the ""How To Draw Anime"" style used for character portraits and cutscenes).  The story is decent enough.  You unlock abilities as you progress which allow you to reach previously inaccessable areas in a Metroidvania style, but the rewards are typically generic chests of cash and healing items so there's not much motivation to backtrack much.The major letdown of the game is, sadly, the gameplay.  It feels like a lot of potential went to waste.  Pretty much every battle in the entire game, including boss fights, can easily be won by spamming the projectile dust attack.  It's ridiculously effective in all situations and so easy to do that you won't bother with the other things the game tried to include - throws, counters, combos, etc.A few other aspects also seem out of balance - I always had WAY more money than I needed, and getting good gear seemed too easy.After a few hours of playing, my main reason for sticking with it was just wanting to finish it.  Didn't take too long, and gameplay was fun enough despite the flaws and lack of challenge.  If you don't pay much for it and are looking for a simple mashy game?  Go nuts.

This game is now literally paid to win as weapon skins, which can only be purchased with real money, provide stat boosts, as if DLCs that provide attachments that also provide stat boosts are not enough.Everything else is copied from Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, including the rarity, ""safes"", keys, and the 'Inspect Weapon' animation.Shame on you Overkill.Will NOT recommend.- StorylineThere is not much plot to PAYDAY 2, which is staged in Washington, DC and you are offered contracts by various key contractors who either request you help trasport narcotics, rob a bank, rob a big bank, rob a engine prototype or simply changing election results in favour of ""Four Men, All Votes"" instead of ""One Man, One Vote"". Community suggestions also led to introduction of new weapons and the break-out of a fellow heister who was sabotaged. However, some other extremely common community suggestions appear to be ignored or unaddressed.- GameplayThe heists are dynamic in a sense as camera placements, loot quantities and placements as well as guard routes can change every time the map is played, similar to that of Left 4 Dead 2. Different events can also happen for the same heist and pose a challenge to the players -- although some do get annoying at times and when you've played long enough, you'll become experienced enough to handle the same old variations.Some of the heists are also quite short-lived, as they can end as quickly as they were started and there are not much objectives in the heists, making the robberies highly repetitive and likely boring. A new friend of mine was shocked at the completion of the heist within 3 minutes. Newer heists such as The Big Bank Heist and Hoxton Breakout provide a quicker pace and a longer fight between the law enforcers and you -- but similarly it does not provide much variations. As such, the game has a balance of good and dull heists -- I had expected better seeing the awards though.There are four difficulties ranging from Normal to Death Wish, where Overkill would be the commonest difficulty when you're experienced and Death Wish would provide a truly engaging experience, unless you are stealthing and have not been caught. However, if you are new to the game, don't be eager to start in these high difficulties (although Normal difficulty is truly boring even for a low level).You can heist in Singleplayer mode, which limits you to yourself and 2 team AI bots, or you can play Multiplayer with 3 other players. The Singleplayer mode, which can be played offline, is annoying as Overkill reduced the number of bots from 3 to 2. Although the bots are tank on their own and can regenerate health and ammo, the bots lack skills and ability to help transport loot, making the player ""all on their own"" to carry out the goals. Bots can also be interrupted by law enforcers and makes it extremely annoying when they stop reviving you to fight back even when you're going to custody in a second or the revival would complete in a second. Bots are also essentially useless in stealth missions and all they do is to prepare in case the heist gets loud. In Multiplayer, things are more interesting and PAYDAY 2 mainly revolves around multiplayer as different user interactions definitely makes the heist experience a more unique one.Bugs are also common (to an extent) in PAYDAY 2. While some are fixed in the following few patches, others appear to be unresolved from day one till now.- GraphicsPlaying on 1920 x 1080 resolution, there has not been any major, gameplay-affecting pixelation yet and the lighting effects are not over-emphasised (which can cause the light bulbs to be brighter than the sun). The law enforcers' faces, especially the snipers, do look contorted though and probably can be improved. Some jagged edges are visible though unlikely to be noticed in normal gameplay. Graphic designs are however, in general, not neglected. Walls are vandalised with graffiti instead of being left blank, food menus in the cafe stores are actually filled up and paintings can be destroyed.That being said, the textures and details are often extremely blurred, such as the bank branding on ATM doors and food products. Even if you argue that the grafitti blurred out due to age, it's too blurred for any monitor with a resolution greater than 720p (or somewhere there). Although this game is a few years old, with the constant updates and huge game file size, you would think it has better graphics than the current, outdated one.- Character Feature(s)PAYDAY 2 follows system similar to that of RPG where there are 5 skill trees and several perk builds for you to choose from. You gain skill points upon leveling up and perk points upon receiving XP. Although more dynamic compared to PAYDAY 1 as every player will now have (slightly) different builds and thus different abilities (compared to a high level player which simply has everything), the grinding can get tedious once you have reached level 70+ or 80+. This has been more or less rectified with the XP changes and it has been much easier to level up since then.PAYDAY 2 also allows more customisation compared to PAYDAY 1, where you can customise the mask colour, pattern and texture instead of simply choosing the masks. This allows more than a few million combinations for masks to choose from (although some are downright unappealing). Masks are purely cosmetic and do not affect gameplay, other than showing your artistic sense.Weapons can also be customised using the limited range of weapon modifications, which can be extended via DLC to gain access to better or more flexible mods. Some mods are achievement-locked and require you to grind for them.- MusicThe soundtracks suits the gameplay rather well, tensing up when law enforcement assault starts and slowing down when it ends, giving an additional brief respite. Depending on the heist the soundtrack was based on, it can be classical music, a retro-styled music or even just ""exciting"" music that you can follow to. The soundtrack DLC is needed if you want the mp3 or FLAC files, which further allows you to customise your in-game soundtracks without the need to purchase other heist DLCs for the soundtrack. - PricingRefer to update.- VerdictAt its age, I would have expected more than DLC-locked content which are pumped out more often than free content (which wouldn't have mattered as much if the DLCs are more reasonably priced). Despite the potential in the game, I am upset that the game has evolved into one that is simply money-making without actual new content.We are not robbing banks, guys. We are the ones getting robbed here.",2014,2

With Cash.Full Review:- StorylineThe plot is simple. There is a war going on between the Builders League United (BLU) and Reliable Excavation Demolition (RED), both subsidiaries of TF Industries. However, due to problems lacking an obvious bureaucratic solution, mercenaries are contracted to address the situation through war. You join one of the two teams (not permanently) and play as one of the nine mercenaries (hereby named 'classes') which each has its own unique features in a war to Attack/Defend (e.g. Payload, Attack/Defend Control Points) or to gain control (e.g. King of the Hill, 5CP, Special Delivery)- Gameplay/ClassesThe nine classes all play an important role in the game and having too many (or the lack thereof) of one class leads to an imbalanced team, causing the team to suffer heavy penalties in terms of co-operating to push towards their objective. The nine classes, Scout, Soldier, Pyro, Demoman, Heavy, Engineer, Sniper Medic and Spy all have their own distinct features, ranging from invisibility cloaks to the all common 420blazeit sniper. The weapons are more or less well-balanced, in the sense that no weapon is vastly considered to be better than the stock or another weapon, although it does suit different fighting styles.With new maps (almost, or at least somewhat) consistently introduced, you get a different gameplay each time as you encounter players who genuinely help the team, players who go in alone and complains no one is there to help, or players who are so accurate with their shots and low ping you don't stand a chance (unless you lag shot them with your 500 ping). You might also join a ""friendly"" server where you see players just taunting and ""Conga-ing"" or walking around, and killing them earns you a kick or a callout for a ♥♥♥♥♥♥.- WeaponsMost weapons are attained through item drops which occur as you play, so as to ""encourage playing"" until the item drop cap for that week is reached. Strange and Festive variants can be obtained by using keys (purchased with Steam Wallet) to unlock normal, rare and seasonal crates. These are however, purely cosmetic and do not affect gameplay in anyway (besides distracting you). Using the weapons you get, you can craft them into another weapon of your liking or even get a chance to craft a more uncommon reskin weapon, such as the Mauler and Sharp Dresser. Some weapons can also be obtained via achievements and in general, the weapons are considered sidegrades -- except for several Medic melee weapons, all the weapons can be considered to be both better and worse than the stock weapon you are given.- Cosmetics & Online InteractionTeam Fortress is well-known as hat simulator. Using the weapon drops you get, you can craft them into Refined Metals and eventually recombine them to get a common (named as 'Unique' in the wiki, and 'Normal' in-game) quality hat (TF2 Premium DLC is required, obtained upon any in-game store purchase). Rarely, you may also get hats or even taunts via item drops. This purely decorates your character but does ""most"" of the gameplay here. Saw that cool-looking unusual guy? Aim him. Saw that gibus (an achievement hat) guy? Aim him. See that guy with ten thousand kills on his strange weapon? Aim him. That dumbass guy who just started playing? Aim him. (There's some toxicity in every game, so expect that.)The cosmetics also run all of the trading in TF2 and it is what allows you to actually earn (or lose) money (in terms of keys) and/or Steam Wallet (by selling the keys on the market). If you are lucky during an unbox, you can also get an Unusual-quality cosmetic or taunt, basically a normal cosmetic or taunt with an additional effect, and this fetches a very high price in the market due to its highly valued effects (market and player dependent).You can play the game fine if you do not care for cosmetics and you can simply find some traders or trading sites to exchange for the weapon you want. Trading is based on own personal experience which is unique to almost everyone and this cannot exactly be reviewed. Online interactions are not rated.- VerdictIt's a fine game for playing, similar to those less traditional FPS that you play, i.e. not the Counter-Strike types. Other than tryhards who remain tryhards and you can never kill them, or beggars or trolls which you can mute or change a server, this game offers many playstyles which will definitely suit you, at least one way or another.",2013,2

There's still plenty of room for improvement.Full Review:- GameplayThe game concept is simple. For campaign, you have to survive a group of invading dinosaurs that will only invade you after you start your first generator and after which, you have to drive/walk/fly a long distance to activate your inappropriately-marked second base. The ""Capturing Base"" message only appeared after I was some distance away from move the marker and the base itself.For survival, it's self-explanatory. For PvP, it's self-explanatory. For sudden death, it's self-explanatory (if you've played other games that have this). Every other mode other than campaign revolves around these 3 modes, only difference lies in whether it's a team or one man army or which weapons you get to use.- Changes in GameplayThe last time I played this game was close to a year ago. I played only Singleplayer and gameplay was at best average. You go around capturing bases, shooting dinosaurs, and perhaps exploiting the map to your advantage. Everything else was left to yourself. There are 3 markers indicating where to get weapons, skills and vehicles. That was about it. Even after the transition from Orion Horde to Prelude, I found it rather boring. Along with a non-existent support team, I decided to abandon the game.Many months later, I saw their latest video advertisement showcasing ""how much their game has improved"". Reluctantly, I decided to give it a try. (To my surprise,) they had actually improved on Singleplayer mode. You no longer fight alone and have four (relatively dumb) teammates which will help you when you go down, without desperately trying to get a last wind. Campaign-wise, I haven't managed to get pass the first few bases because the AI wouldn't follow and I ended up getting plummeted by two triceratops. That wasn't fun (to die and lose), but nonetheless interesting.- Graphics/Visual AppealDespite the ""massive overhaul"" from Orion Horde to Prelude, there was not much change in the menu layout and character design. Pretty much every customisation requires you to buy for real money (or earned by unlocking numerous achievements), and the graphics are rather dated (pixelated with its bad geometrical shapes). The only thing that impressed me was the main menu background and that's about it.In the game itself the developers have noticeably added the weather effect. Your screen will occasionally blur due to the snow and there is a consistent (but annoying) white border around your screen because of snow blowing on your face (at least that's what I interpreted it as). The added weather effects are appreciated and helps you to ""focus"" on the game. However, other than that first glance, every other models such as the vehicles, weapons, et cetera are pretty much mediocre. The text do not scale well with the resolution and exceeds the screen (so the skill name and description is cut off for me) and the border between the background and the text is not consistent. Skill icons are also exactly the same as when the game costed USD15.00 before the overhaul to Prelude, which would have been fine if the icon were not extremely visually unappealing. Think of the icons as having secondary school or fresh college students (not graduates) drawing them. It's not simple enough to be ""simple"" or complex enough to be ""complex"". It's just... Well, the trailers don't show you the skill icons, do they?- Bugs (?)There are some noticeable features that I can't really describe it as bug or glitch or whatsoever, because I have no idea if they were meant to be a feature or a bug. For example, you are able to buy the same skill as many times as you want, so long you have the credits from killing dinosaurs. I have no idea whether buying the same skill again have any upgrades (because the skill description remains exactly the same and there is no indication of current level) or it's just bugged and wasting my credits (because even the skill icon colour, everything else remains the same). Sometimes I am also spawned way, way, too far away from the base when I just started the campaign and have to activate the generator to start the game. Again, I have no idea whether being spawned 400 metres away from your main and first base is a feature or a bug.- VerdictBy now, you'd probably wonder why the hell am I recommending this game after such negative experience and I have only 3 hours on record. I'd say the game is actually worth that $1.00 if you have friends to play with. It's fun for a while, and you could probably find some easter eggs here and there and explore the terrain. The terrain is rather big, but there's no sandbox option for me to explore so I can't rate the maps very accurately and I'll leave it out from the gameplay part. After all, with dumb AI, you can't do much (albeit more than without AI). However, if you got no friends who will play this with you (or can't seem to find one) and/or the game reverts to its original Orion Horde price of USD15.00, I'd say skip it. It's seriously not fun playing alone. I would have given this a mixed review if possible, or else a bad review. But for its price, it's hard to argue.",2015,0

When I first got the game, the user reviews were mostly positive. Now it's mixed, so you can probably tell from that too. Full Review:- Gameplay & GraphicsWhile the scenes in the video look nice, playing it in 2014 with a 1680 x 1050 resolution and later in 2015 with a 1920 x 1080 resolution makes me feel like crying. If you force the game to full screen, it's pixelated, else it's small. I could adjust my default screen resolution to suit the game, but this simply reinforces that the game is outdated. It may be good in 2006, but certainly not now. The controls are your typical WASD and mouse interaction, while for the gameplay itself, I did not fully explore the game so I cannot offer a full storyline review. However, from my early stages in the game, it takes way too long to travel from one point to another with little to offer. While Far Cry also requires you to walk a long distance, at least you get to hunt some game. Not in Just Cause 1. It's just holding W and hoping someday, you get there.- AudioThe music and sound effects are pretty average in my opinion. I'm not a fan of it, but taste is subjective.- VerdictDon't buy it, even it's for a really cheap 90% discount.

Using these two spheres, you attempt to suck youself and navigate through a simple, and then challenging and later split-second-reaction-time terrains. There are no background story as to why you need to navigate through them or whatsoever, so it's just a linear puzzle game. The controls may feel a bit disjointed at times as you have to mash the buttons or else repeat yourself for a few more times.- GraphicsIt's rather simple and there's not much fancy graphics to it, save the cutscene (maybe). The menu and text are easy to read but also, again, rather simple.

It can also be enjoyable, and playing with friends is great too, but there are some majour issues that need to be addressed. For example, for some reason (and not just me) when ever your ping starts to f*ck up, so does your fps, you can be running normally at ultra at 60fps on a 980 (like me) and then just randomly get fps drops that you think is just ping lag, before you realise, nope its your computer. I know somebody with a 980ti that also has the same problem. That's not the only problem, for some reason, i had these HUGE LIGHTS that were apearing out of no where, and almost making me blind. The PC Au servers, are also, terrible (at least there dedicated this time) but still bad, you can one round have the best ping, and then next, awful ping, and my internet isn't even that bad (and i have australian internet ahha). The games killing system and aiming could also be improved... *doesn't help that im not that good of an aim ahah* but still after playing CS:GO for example, i can be doing well in that, and finding that when i get killed its ""oh okay, fair enough"" and when i get a kill ""well that was good"" in BO3, its like when you get killed ""OMG WHAT THE F*CK, HES HACKING OMG THATS SO ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T"" and when you get a kill ""no way i got that?"" and thats just a few things to name. It's also very buggy, and you can tell that it has been rushed, either that or its just a bad console peasent to PC port. I had high hopes for this game, and im not impressed, at all. I did enjoy zombies though and found that enjoyable, and is most likely keeping me from refunding it, its just MP need's to be improved ALOT. Cheers",2015,0

I find that it doesent lag except when you have hundreds of units on the screen at once but only a little.

Really to enjoy this game you need to enjoy these kinds of realtime strategic games, also if you dont know how to play properly you are going to have a very bad time. I will never forget the site of a moon flying towards a planet or completely annihilating a planet with a laser. I think this game is excellent and should be given a shot.

The game is obviously lacking features that is apparent after playing the game for a bit. The AI is buggy and needs a complete redo which according to the developer is what he is currently working on but seems to be taking a while. The game has improved a lot since the last time I reviewed it with the annoying bug of AI walking through walls being fixed. Also, the weapon system was redone with people now being able to find weapon parts and create their own custom weapon using parts such as sights, recievers, barrels, triggers, etc with each part affecting the weapons performace. A new neat physics system was added to bases built by the player so that they crumble into rubble when destroyed. In my opinion the developer is doing a good job and trying but with only one person working on an ambitious game like this, proggress is painfully slow. If your looking for a unique game then you should consider buying the game but if you not prepared to deal with bugs and slow development you shouldn't buy it.

Once I started playing I was addicted. It made me want to complete every ahievement but in reality this is pretty tough.

Its got gore, guns, and great gameplay. Or at least fun gameplay with your friends on a community or Steam created map with your own classes and loadouts. Evil camping snipers or raging heavys will try to take you out in this hectic shooter. Collect items and create new ones. It's a great game that every Steam player must have or simply he can't have fun. Great Game, lacks updates but the community releases and indes bring new life to the game!8/10",2014,2

The DLC Packs: Gods & Kings and Brave New World are overpriced at $25 each however they did provide just enough content to satisfy me. I think because there is such an active community making new mods and maps this game will continue in the future with more DLC being released, Fingers crossed it provides more bang for your buck.

I love it a lot but that doesnt mean it doesnt have its flaws.This DLC, unlike lots of others out there, is not overpriced. It is pretty resonably priced. It is fun, people play it and it really simulates 19TH century warfare very well. But I do think it could do with a decent single player mode, rather than just custom battles, which I do not enjoy. I dont know maybe someones modded in one, but in the vanilla it doesnt.The DLC also has a large community. Many people play it. I just hate MMO titles that are amazing but have no publicity so no one plays them. Napoleonic Wars has many enjoyable gamemodes. My favourite is Team Deathmactch. There is also siege, where one team defends and trys to hold out for a set time and the other tries to capture it. Although, I have experienced a few crashes playing this gamemode, so I dont know whats up with that.I LOVE this DLC. It is well priced, has a good community and great gamemodes.

With the help of the hl2 engine, the graphics, models of weapons and characters, this deserves one of the best shooters game of all time. As well as this, map-making is avaliable to all people who are willing to do it, same with plugins for custom servers, Source Film Maker and many more things. This is overall a stunning game that I have played for a while and deserves a yes. GG Valve.Some things that may put it down, however, would be the fact that some recent updates are very similar in terms of style. For example, the Gun Mettle update brought in contracts, new maps, etc. The halloween update brought in the same thing, but just different missions.People who play other shooter games, that are like COD, Battlefield, etc. One thing i would have to say to those people would be, don't shout at the medic to run to you and specifically YOU because apparantely YOU are the one carrying the team with your gibus and goggles and your natascha, family business and your eviction notice. Pub doesnt work like that, sunshine.As well as this, don't be an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to the new kid or some ♥♥♥♥ just because you got screwed over when you were new. At some point this new kid will have a better inventory, (yes i know just because having an expensive inventory doesnt make you a better player) better items, and a better fighting style. TF2 doesnt need those kinds of ♥♥♥♥♥ on their servers.Either way, although there are some parts of the years to come that will be lazy, there will be better things introduced. Frankly, i want some new weapons, they've been just introducing reskins. Example, Batsaber.Yes.",2015,2

In a game where majority of the gameplay is based off line of sight, and moving without being seen, an AI really destroys it. They can always see you, and never miss as a shark or a diver. They ruin any game almost instantly, but besides that, it's worth buying it when it's on sale.Not entirely sure if it's worth paying full price however, as that's around $80 for you and 3 other friends.

Freeman, después de despertar, no solo se encuentra con científicos heridos y/o muertos, sino también con la fauna de Xen que viajaron atreves de una brecha dimensional. Al ver la situación de emergencia en la que se encontraba no solo el sector, sino también todo Black Mesa, inmediatamente sube a la superficie abriéndose paso entre los Xenianos pero al llegar se encuentra con las fuerzas especiales H.E.C.U. que están “silenciando” a todo el personal de Black Mesa y eliminar todas las pruebas del desastre. Al ver la situación, Freeman se mueve a través de todo Black Mesa para llegar al Complejo Lλmbda y cerrar la brecha dimensional antes de que se extienda por todo el mundo…Jugabilidad...Hλlf-Life es una verdadera obra maestra cuando nos referimos a él como un juego “Single Player”, el objetivo del juego es utilizar pensamientos lógicos y nuestro armamento para sobrevivir en un entorno lleno de enemigos con distintas habilidades, también hay situaciones en el que los puzzles (al menos en los primeros días) pueden llegar a ser un problema.Variedad...El arsenal del juego que es muy variado desde armas simples como la Crowbar, Clock 17, Mp5 y Spas 12, hasta armas potentes, tanto militares, experimentales y alienígenas. No es lo único en variación, también hay una gran cantidad de enemigos como los soldados H.E.C.U., las asesinas Blacks Ops, alienígenas de distintos tamaños y poderes e incluso los guardias de seguridad si llegas a causarle heridas intencionalmente. Y la música no se queda atrás, cada escenario tiene su propio ambiente musical que puede generar tensión o adrenalina en el jugador.Innovación...La interacción con los NPC, el modelado y sus animaciones, para su época, eran sorprendentes, a pesar de que en ciertos momentos pueden sufrir de glitches. Los gráficos de ese momento, los efectos de luces y sombras, diseños del entorno y la ambientación, Hacen que el jugador realmente sienta que está dentro del juego, esto es gracias a su motor GoldSrc, una versión modificada del motor Quake.Multijugador...El multijugador de Hλlf-Life tampoco ha quedado de lado, su gran variación de armas, los orificios de bala en las paredes, salpicaduras de sangre o mejor, despedazar los cuerpos de los jugadores, la posibilidad de crear servers dedicados, la gran variedad de mapas incluyendo los oficiales y los que fueron creados por la comunidad, los personajes para controlar aunque en este aspecto hay pocos, aun así el jugador puede agregar más personajes al multijugador aunque los demás jugadores no tendrán la posibilidad de verlo.Mods...Como último punto, el motor GoldSrc, es un motor fácilmente manipulable, tanto que se han creado  varios mods del juego, como los más conocidos como Counter-Strike y Team Fortress, hasta los más olvidados como Deathmatch Classic y Ricochet, aunque estos son mods oficiales, la comunidad ha creado gran variedades de mods como USS Darkstar, Azure Sheep y Sven Coop.Puntos Negativos...Los únicos puntos malos del juego son que en el viaje del inicio es muy largo, aunque esto se puede omitir con la consola, la poca variedad que hay con los aliados, que son solo un científico con cuatro modelos de personajes y un guardia de seguridad, las armas y enemigos de la versión βeta que no aparecieron ni siquiera en el multijugador, y el no incluir la campaña especial “Decay”, un modo de juego exclusivo de Play Station 2 que permite jugar con 2 científicas.GAMEPLAY:             SOUND:                HISTORY:               INNOVATION:★★★★★          ★★★★★          ★★★★★          ★★★★★DIFFICULTY:            GRAPHICS:              DURATION:             TOTAL:★★★✩✩          ★★★★★          ★★★★★          ★★★★★http://store.steampowered.com/app/70",2015,0

This is almost always the case in Japanese, where verbs have transitive and intransitive forms, but this is not listed in the definition, only one form is presented. This means doing research on the word you'll find yourself using more will help you be more fluent in the long run.-So much katakana... I'd like to see really rare kanji forms of words, as they can appear in stories and some videogames (You know, like English games using the words, 'Thee', 'Thou', etc. They're rare because of their age, but they can still find a use in medieval style games!). In fact, I might prefer it that way as I want to learn as much words as possible and converting English to katakana is easy when you learn about how Japanese pronunciation works. Just add a note to say it's rare to avoid confusion.-Some objects are... Odd. I saw this red box and the definition said it was a piggy bank or something, I was confused until I saw a dial, which meant it was a safe. Maybe you should make objects cliched/stereotyped and exaggerated to help people understand with a quick glance.-It doesn't follow spaced repitition, so you can mash the replay button endlessly until you get yourself a star. If you're a serious learner, never press the replay button, as you just bring it back to your short term memory and fail to remember it the next few days, at least space the replays by an hour the *first* time you try it.-Lists make it too easy sometimes, avoid using them and just use the random button, as I found myself just clicking whatever's next to the last object I clicked on, as I was able to remember the next thing I added right after. This is a mnemonic that relies on the location of the object INGAME, so it doesn't really help you learn. If you really want to do lists, run around the whole house clicking random items and adding them to the list, avoiding any sort of order or pattern.And here's some tips for Japanese:-Avoid Romaji, in fact, do kanji, when you don't know a word, you don't know it, there's no improving your ability to decipher meaning from kanji, so just dive right into it. Do kana if you're really keen on learning pronunciation before reading, and want to do it really, really quickly. Same thing probably applies with Pinyin and Hanzi, but I haven't played  the Chinese version so I don't know if Pinyin is provided.-The dots that appear between kana when you look at how to read the kanji is important, memorise the kana in sections divided by the dots, and their associated kanji (e.g. (毎日 [まい＊にち] まい is 毎 and にち is 日)) This is important, words might have multiple readings, and you might get them wrong, but if you memorise at least ONE reading for the kanji, you can type it on a computer, and even get the correct reading by typing the kanji on a dictionary.-While katakana is easy when you know it well enough, sometimes it isn't, as you might say different versions of a word (E.g. Fairy Floss vs. Cotton Candy, (Well, it's neither when translated to Japanese, but you get my point!)) or it's just katakana but isn't based on English, (e.g. パン for bread). Either way, it's nice to learn a ton of katakana in this game as you get badges for it.Other than that, it's good as you'll find objects in an every day home, and the exploration stops you from being bored quickly, and most importantly:It makes you think of (and therefore associate the word you're learning with) objects and pictures, rather than the English translation, which means that you can achieve fluency which allows you to form sentences in the language you want in your head directly, rather than creating an English sentence, translating it to your wanted language, THEN saying, writing or expressing it.",2014,2

Also, all high level equipment are sorted by level, so if you can't buy it with ingame currency, it means specialising isn't a very good idea until you get to a higher level. Payable items don't have this restriction, so very powerful equipment can be put in the hands of new players. Keep in mind that all equipment has a bonus, but an equal penalty, making it not ""powerful"" in a linear sense, but if you specialise in a way that suits your playstyle, it makes you more powerful (but doing this early can bar you from changing your strategy and trying new techniques.)In terms of gameplay, everyone is -mostly- equal, some more general and some more specialized, it depends mostly on skill. Some elements are more powerful than others, not statistically, but in usage and opportunities to cast with most effect.",2014,2

When you have your back to the wall, facing down a Fleshpound and a Scrake, with nothing left but a knife and dead teammates, it really makes your adrenaline kick in. The fact that this game is generally focussed on (but not limited to) multiplayer and teamwork is what makes it that much more enjoyable. Why face hordes of endless flesh-eating creatures alone, when you can share the fun of burning them, blowing them up and hacking them apart with a team?

It ruins the experience if your constantly finding bugs that may be small still ruin things or make the game frustrating. Another major concern i have is that you need a pretty damn good rig in order to run this, i can usually run all my games (Steam and non-steam) at their highest settings, ARK however for whatever reason i have severe trouble to run on even its lowest settings. Now i know some of you will go ""Get a better rig"" well that doesn't solve much as it is the job of the Dev team to make the game accessible to as many people as they can, and in order to do that they need to get on top of fixing and optimising the game rather than adding more features. so no i can't reccommend the game IN ITS CURRENT STATE, however if the Dev team is able to address the many issues with this game and do something simmilar to what Space Engineers is doing right now, where the devs arehalting addition of features and are just focusing on fixing the current bugs, then i'd give it a positive review...",2015,2

Well I'm in it so it's guaranteed to be epic. All jokes aside though the game is awesome, and you can read my review to know more.The game overall is awesome, it's like borderlands 2, but it's better. The Scaling in BL2, was horrible from level 50 upwards. You need OP and Gamebreaking gear to get anywhere in the game fomr UVHM onwards. And I can already see the scaling in this game is a lot better. I'm able to now use Purple guns to defeat a raid boss, solo. The visuals, can be a little repetitive at times, but overall they are appealing and does bring different environments into the game. Now as for gameplay, well, many, including me who had seen the gameplay, thought that the butt-stomp ability would be a gimmick in the game that I would never use. I was wrong. It adds so much more to the combat, in addition with the low gravity, killing is a lot more fluid, getting around on foot isn't so boresome, and depending on how you use your ""double jump"", and where you activate the extra boost, gives completely different outcomes. For example, if I need to get to a higher ledge, a jump and boost when i'm halfway until the fulcrum of my jump, giving me a way higher jump. But If I was to say get passed a very wide crevice I would start sprinting, jump then activate the boost before I start descending. And this all may seem simple, but it can be applied to the combat maneuvres and it overall makes combat more pleasing. I particularly like to use the second descripted type of jump a lot when traversing without a vehicle, it practically triples my movement time and comes in handy, even in the normal gravity environments, such as Helios.Now for Classes. Of course everyone started the game as claptrap, so i'm going to go and do something different like I usually do, I played the game as Nisha, speccing into her middle and right trees, and found myself being basically a god, maybe here is where the teamwork really comes into play. Having all 4 Nisha's running around wouldn't work, because you have no way of healing or buffing teammates. Nisha is a very combat centred solo class. And I would say she is needed for every kind of boss fight, she deals damage and deals it where it matters. Claptrap, is a must have, he gives the team random buffs, and helps out alot with co-op, lots of health boosts, dmg boosts etc. Athena plays the role of the tank healer, she is a great class to play as with friends, although solo not so much. Her abilities are a lot like Maya's except she soaks up damage. She is also a vital part to the team, giving out lots of Health regen. I didn't play wilhelm much, but from what I did, He is just a straight up tank class. He takes all of the damage dealt while dealing a fair enough amount of damage. He is the most Balanced class from what i've played of him but isn't very fun (for lack of better term), So overall the classes have their own Pros and cons and they all do their own special thing that makes them vital to the team.As an overall, I'd say the game does use lots of content from Borderlands 2, including some legendaries and renamed Unique guns. The humour is a step up from Borderlands 2 and as an Australian I did get all of the jokes, so that could be a downside for some players who don't know much of Australian slang and colloquialism. But yes, the humour is well done and implemented, the story is EXCELLENT. I love it. *No spoilers* I hate lilith for what she did to jack, and I empathised for Jack as the hours passed. Some of the negative reviews here state that the campaign didn't give enough XP to get to the required levels, but that's because they didn't do the side missions, which were frankly better this time around. There is a lot more variety and SO MUCH story to be told in the side missions, like how Terramorphous made it onto Pandora, when Threshers where only a Moon Species (DAMN YOU HAMMERLOCK), or how Jack comes up with the idea of Moonshotting loaders to Pandora etc. Lots of things storywise are excellent, with a nice twist on Jack at the end and how he gets the scar on his face. The story just blew my mind the first time around, and I stuck around long enough for 3 more playthroughs up to TVHM and still find it enjoyable. I especially can't wait for the UVHM pack that will have a new Narrative Voice over along with Tiny Tina. Overall Game was excellent.Now for a short list of Pros and Cons incase you don't want to read all that garbage.Pros:- Story- Classes- Visuals- Soundtrack- Gameplay- Combat- Low Gravity- Enemy Scaling- Weapon Scaling- Replayability (I'd die if I didn't put that in there)Cons:- Nisha and Claptrap are the only 2 classes that are really enjoyable in SP and MP- Wilhelm and Athena lack enough SP Skills to play SP, but are both great for MP- Not as many legendaries- Maybe too many reused Borderlands 2 Assets- Comedy can get a little dry after a whileAnyway that's my Review of Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel I give this game an overall of:8.7/10. It's more of the same which isn't bad, it still has that Borderlands Charm, it delivers where in lots of ways Borderlands 2 failed. And even though it seems mediocre amongst many giants coming out this year, it's defenitely my Game of the Year. I can't wait for the Doppelganger Pack release tomorrow, and like i've said many many times. This game overall is excellents. It's a must buy for borderlands fans, and a must buy if you want to try out the series. TL;DR Game overall is excellent, more of the same Borderlands you love while changing it up a bit. New players will love it, while old fans will cherish it.",2014,2

It was true at the time but since then the game has been abandoned by the developers, traded in for the PS4 version instead. They ceased development on the PC version and have since closed down the Australian servers, making it unplayable for anyone in the area (including myself). The matchmaking for other servers is garbage as well, taking decades to find a lobby.This game is trash now and I'm glad to be not installing it again after reading the reviews for the game, and now giving my own.

When you first start playing things can seem a bit overwhelming and especially if you're playing online not everyone is forgiving towards new players, but its definately easier to complete jobs online than with bots offline. the only thing that was disappointing was that its alot more work to create custom masks than i feel its worth, you need any combination of 3 components to make one: material, pattern, and paint. and the only way to get anyone of these at a time is as a random drop at the end of each completed mission, but you also have the chance of getting bonus cash, bonus xp, or a weapon mod (mods that you have to pay ludicrous amounts for to then actually use anyway, so thats another thing), but overall its an exellent game and highly recomended. dont feel bad if you're a lpw level, it doesnt take long to level up online and doing more difficult jobs with higher level plays who can carry you through jobs.",2014,2

Ultimately, i feel like the reward system is a bit harsh because you have to buy the same things multiple times if you want to use more than one mech, but other than that its a great game and i highly recommend it",2014,2

Mission settings such as ""onsluaght mode"" makes things interesting in the sense that you can have it off and run through the missions as intended and take your time, or turn it on to penalize slow movement due to massive hoardes that... well swarm... you every minute whether you move or not. Vast types of aliens keeps you on your toes and its a game thats overall pretty simple to learn (also has offline practice that offers hints or for you to test different load outs which is fun), then if you havent played in a while you can get right back into it, just like riding a bike",2014,2

I found some of my strategies failed because they would be bombarded by units.

Second of all I believe that this game is extremely fun when you first start playing because you are in a first person shooter and a class based system which i completely think that is a great  idea because NO one likes playing a world wide multi-player game with only everyone using the same 'class'. Last but not least if your worried about being hacked dont be this game is very secure and believe me everyone I know has never in their life been hacked on this game because it is so secure.-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_Z_k50ltkY,2015,0

This game is made for people who are 18 years and older. The question I have is why is this game a ""low violence version"" it is only for people 18 years and older. I understand its because its pretty full on. Being an adult means you have access to Uncensored stuff, adult movies, guns, etc. But why is this game censored for adults who paid good money for something that should not be censored. The logic makes no sence. Even the South Park TV show is Uncensored at MA+15. Why Censore a game at R+18? This is absolutely Outrageous. ITS SOUTHPARK. COME ON. PATCH IT SO IT IS UNCENSORED!",2014,0

Who says a simple game can be something giant like a mundial tournament.This movie doesn't only for DotA specially but for every single competitive game. Also raise up a great reflection, worth give up of college, family, friends and of live your always-life just for do what you like and be paid for it?Even if you're not a DotA player watch this, worth so much, I honestly don't play but is the second time that I see since was released last year and is amazing the way they retract and show what is e-sports, furthermore is just 1h29min.:D :)   Análise em português :Melhor documentário sobre o que é e-sports, apesar de o foco ser APENAS no DotA, já mostra o quão incrível é essa área. Quem diria que um simples jogo pode se transformar em algo grande como um torneio mundial.Esse filme não serve apenas para DotA mas para os jogos competitivos em geral. E também levanta uma grande reflexão, será que vale a pena deixar os estudos de lado, família, amigos e de viver a sua vida de sempre para fazer o que você gosta e ser pago por isso?Mesmo que você não jogue DotA assista esse documentário, vale muito a pena, eu não jogo mas é a segunda vez que assisto desde quando lançou ano passado e é inacreditável a maneira que eles retratam e o mostram o que são e-sports, além do mais é apenas 1h29m.:D :)",2015,2

The single player is a fun experience with no real problems, so read on. Okay, so you are wondering if GTA ONLINE would be a fun experience... Well it is, if you can actually make it into a server without the game putting you in singleplayer for no reason... My favourite is when you connect to a server but the Rockstar cloud services screw up and you can't save any progress :^( What's the point of waiting for those incredibly long loading screens for something that is just stuffed?...You run out of stuff to do eventually Heists become a chore or (mostly) unplayable if you don't have friends there, races and stuff are always won by sweaty plebs that do nothing but learn each race track all day and to top it all off, hackers can hack with ease and with little indication of slowing down... Yes, they remove your guns, can't be killed, spawn NPCs and other objects and also have the ability to blow up everyone on the server at once, thus making the freeroam experience broken as hell.DO NOT buy this game until a price drop even if bonus GTA online cash is offered... You can always buy cash cards later (or better yet just play the game...)The fact that we waited for a PC release this long and the game has just been broken after a recent patch (not the first time) is sad... I hardly play this game anymore...",2015,0

Valve brought in a new gun, the Revolver. This weapon on first glance is pretty cool although it might need a few tweeks. The area in which is ♥♥♥♥ about this game is the new way the game is displayed. A lot of my friends think that maybe the graphics are worse now as well. Also the crosshair is different and I'm speaking for myself and a lot of my friends when I say that it is so so so bad. Honestly the new crosshair is terible. If there was one thing Valve could take from this review it would be please oh please change the crosshair back. The old one really was much better in every way.

""Leave it open - it's designed to run in the periphery of your life. Only interact with it when you feel like it. You can play Mountain while playing other games. If you are not playing it, it will play itself."" Based on this, you're not meant to 'play' it, you're supposed to chill and listen to the soothing sound tracks. I seriously recommend getting this. Why? The sounds are brilliant. I don't spend time watching everything that has changed in the game. No. I leave it open while I read, or study, or when I'm showering. I sometimes leave it open when I sleep. Those haters are 'hardcore' players, while poeple like me and some few others enjoy the sounds of nature. In a nutshell, if you game to be a professional gamer in any sense (Dota2, CS:GO etc) you might regret getting this game but this would be the least regretul game you have bought.

I can tell those who have never played a game like this, without teamwork, your team is doomed. There are different Classes/Character, various of maps and modes. Can't really get bored unless your team is not cooperating at all. By the way, there is a tutorial in the game, which really helps.For those newbies, I would personally pick the Soldier as your first-try Class. He uses a Rocket Launcher! the first time I use this guy, I was all like ""Eat rocket!!"" while shooting randomly. Anyway, he does a lot of damage, plus your health is one of the highest in the game. You can also shoot at your feel right after you jump to Rocket Jump. This will give you advantage to quickly get into the front lnes, to get to a higher spot, or just to run away from trouble.

Arcade mode is the mode where a randomly-generated map is made and your dwarfs will dig literally mindlessly to look for gold or any other materials. But be warned, apart from Trasure Caves, there are also caves that contain enemies, water that would flood your village and lava that would burn everything in your village. Your enemy will attack your base and kill all the dwarfs they come across.

First of all, let me start off by saying that Black Ops 3 is a Triple A title meaning that it has a huge corporate funding behind it. Obviously we'd think that the game would at least be half decent with such a large budget and skilled staff behind its creation. Well, no. This game feels like it had about 10 million dollars in the graphics department and maybe 10000 dollars in the bugs/glitch avoidance, gameplay, story line, and online matchmaking departments. The game is terribly optimised especially for PC and the reviews it got on every professional gaming website/magazine was 100% f***ing paid for! 9/10 on some websites? B*****it! The worst part about this game is the part that everybody wants, the damn multiplayer. Now this has more issues than anything in the game. When you think about the issues with other multiplayer games you think of  things such as bad servers, ping issues, or just bad ping/lag compensation. Well, this game has all of those and more! If you're looking to play a game with more than one of your friends then this is definitely not the game you're looking for. Around 90% of the time you try to join someone else's lobby with more than one person already in it, it starts a s**t storm of errors for you and your friends. Constant error messages saying ""error lobby is full"" (even if you're the only one in the lobby) and it might as well just say ""error go f**k yourself"". Matchmaking also brings along a great new feature called ""get screwed over by the same person several times in the span of 10 seconds!"". Now this is a fantastic little thing that COD has added to their online mode and it allows you to be spawn f***ed by the same player over and over again until you just want to Alt + F4. Their respawn system is so insanely broken that sometimes you just spawn in the middle of a bunch of enemies, which sounds great for some people because you can just spray them down but that's never the case. Finally this online mode brings a final, new way to be screwed over by anyone you run into because well lets face it, you're **t at this game. But hey I don't blame you! When you're level 1 you're constantly being bombarded by a bunch of 4 times prestiged players who have no life or are just really damn good at the game. Honestly, kudos to them for getting such a high level so quickly but at the same time screw you Activision! Starting players can barely start until they're around lvl 10 and get a half decent gun with some attachments and by then your KD and Win/Loss ratio is already f***ed beyong repair. So in conclusion, this game is probably one of the worst Triple A title games you will ever purchase and whether the Triple A title is worth $15 or $100 (like this one) this game is definitely not worth it in anyway. The PC optimisation is absolutely terrible with a bombshell of issues from frame lag to being unable to play the damn game until you have at least spent a solid s***ty night or two getting destroyed by fellow players.",2015,0

There's a wide variety of weapons and planes to choose from, with even more coming. The maps are perfectly sized and creative, and I would personally love to see even more. There's also a nice amount of gamemodes to choose from and I've found almost no bugs/glitches.The 2 main problems I see with this game are:-A little bit pricey for an early access game. I understand if you need a wider budget or something, but $10 just seems a little too much.-Nobody ever seems to be playing it. Seriously. The servers are always deadly quite. There is a subreddit dedicated to this game with regular developer updates and the server list makes it look like nobody plays anymore. I am honestly confused; where are all the players?But overall, Air Brawl is a good game with a bright future.(As a side note, something I would love to see in this game is music. It would be awesome to have the kind of music from the trailer playing while you're in the middle of an intense fight.)",2015,2

The jist of this game is to buy stuff as cheap as possible, sell that stuff as expansive as possible then rinse and repeat. I don't always play this simulator as the gameplay gets quite repetitve and it's hard to get items that are on fire ""cause fire n warm glowy stuff"" - Trading cornmunity on a regular basis. Other than these flaws the gameplay is fine. You have 9 classes, Scout he has +50% profit and +75% chance of ruining your day and sadly you can only play him in 4 colors black, white, pink and green he isn't a very good stealth class because his vibrant colors standout on the maps making me think they didn't think it through when choosing his color scheme.Soldier he has +40% profit -15% speed and +60% dressing apeal. He too falls to the same flaws as the scout having only 2 color choices pink and green. Despite his -15% speed he can sacrifice a chunk of his health to do a super jump, although they say you use the rocket launcher to do this you end up exploding into millions of pieces you actually hold down right click to charge it and let go while looking up to perform this move. This class is overall good and can help you out if making profit is a bit time consuming and boring with his increased dressing apeal can add a few extra hours of fun just by dressing him up.Pyro he has +25% profit +999% speed while target is in contact by flames, +85% outfit diversity and 65% more confusion. Her main weapon is the flamethrower which allows major bursts of speed if you set people on fire making him a very interesting but new players should avoid using her as his most game changing ability is her comrpession blast which can defend you by deflecting rockets, grenades, plasma grenades, ariplanes, soldiers, wild cabermen and steam flash sales but you have to time his ability or else you'll be hit which is why she isn't recomended for new players. With the highest outfit diversity in the game he can create intersting and profitable combos which also requires a decent amount of experince to even pull off.Demoman has +35% profit, +50% boom, -25% outfit diversity, +999% damage only active with stock secondary and +45% stealth (Only active during the night). This ""unique"" looking individual is the explosive expert of the team with his loadout that consist of sharp blades, shields and boots making him an agile tank of destruction, pairing this up with the stock secondary makes you invincible because your aura becomes so strong from the damage increase everything gets ripped from reality and only requires you to press two buttons repeatedly making him easily the best class in combat. Unfourtunatly despite his godly stats in combat he falls short in profiting abilities with having outfits of things from the past, making diversity a problem and can hinder his profit stat.Heavyweapons has -35% speed, +90 more ammo, +10% profit, +60 more gun, +45% outfit diversity +175 bulk. This character is a mixed bag for combat and profit his combat ability is soaking damage and retaliating but he is slow forcing him into a more defence gameplay which can be quite slow and doesn't feel rewarding and the fact that demoman's damage is off the charts the heavy can only last 3 seconds once he enters the demoman's 30 metre aura making this class redundant. As for profit he can be very effective if you can find someone who prefers this characters outfits which because of his offical mascot status can make this quite easy to find. Oh an also the heavy has a hidden ability called ""Thick Fat"" which makes him take 50% less damage from temperature based attacks.The Engineer has +35% profit, +90% calm down, +35% fun and -20% height. Don't look at that -20% height as a bad thing that can be the difference between life and death (even though the characters share the same hit boxes for most projectiles.) and with his sentry gun ability you can create a machine gun that has aimbot and can even upgrade it to shoot rockets aswell making this class easily the most defensive class and with his +90% calm down stat makes him a good switch after a stressful day of ripping people off. The engineers outfit divirsity is interesting and quite large but nothing like the pyros.The elusive Medic has +0.005% speed, +80% happiness, -45% damage, +60% crit ratio, -90% common. The medic is a god send in the meta-game and has the most complex and useful magic attacks in the game with such abilities such as partner shield, skill crits and restore these along can be used together to create devastating combos that can counter even the demomans destructive aura which is why they used this spell combinations on the already powerful demoman to tripple his aura's damage and radius. The truth to why the medic is so powerful is because of how rare and fragile they are but when someone experienced enough gets ahold of one they can unleash hell. The medic is soley combat orientated the only ability in profit he is capable of is restoring hats to their original form.Sniper has +90% common, +90% new players, -100% usefullness in large numbers, -70% productivity, -35% vision and -75% interesting outfits. This class can be beast in the hands of a pro but will still be destroyed by demomen, making him pointless and all you can do for fun is scope in atleast with soldier and scout you can do something intersting with them and too many new players choose him like some kind of god or something as if it's the ♥♥♥♥ in some other game or something like and fail with him that and then we end up having just scouts, snipers and spies. It's just as bad for profit they only have 2 colors pink and green which is a small choice for making profits plus people are lazy with how they look and take the generic stuff angus hood, outback interlectual, that berret with a little shield on it, those sound thingys from apple that hurt your ears and that leather thing for his face and nothing else making him a very linear and boring class combat and profit wise.Spy has +80% commons, +90% new players, -80% usefullness in large numbers, -55% productivity, +60% style, -75% visibility and +55% stealth. The spy has the same faults as the sniper combat wise the demomans arua wrecks him and and too many inexperienced players choose him. The worse part is that they don't even bother trying to use the revolver his only way of self-defense other than the energy shield watch. Along with this he is a very paitent and slow class that requires finding the right momment to strike and the right momment to run. Profit wise he has a hole wardrobe of stylish fedoras and diverse suits making him a very interesting class for profiting.If you're a fan of tycoon games this might be right up your alley.8.9/10",2013,2

Hardly any lag or bugs so far, simply because I don't play on public servers, so I can't say anything about that. But going Han Solo gives you a great experience without aggressive players. The beginning is the most challenging part, because you start out naked somehwere on an island called ""PEI"", with nothing but a flashlight and maybe a candy bar and a juice box. Or, if you dislike getting killed by zombies, there's the map ""Arena"" which has a slight Hunger Games feel.Pros:-It's free-Little bugs or lag-Low(ish) learning curve-Variety of locations-Realistic-ish needs such as Thirst, Hunger, Sickness, and Stamina-Energy Drinks-Simple graphics-Skill cusomization-Did I mention it was free?Cons:-Heard of hackers on public servers-Heard of very aggressive players on public servers-Very easy after getting settled in with good items-Need to use the wiki for crafting-Only two, medium-sized mapsEnd Result:Get it, definitely! It's free, so you won't feel guilty about spending money if you dislike the game. Also, by the end of January there is a scheduled 3.0 update, that will hopefully fix most bugs and glitches, add a new ""Canada"" map, the largest map in the game, update the crafting, update the vehicles, and even add a new neccesity related to how cold you are. You can check the map update news yourself for some hype-inducing preview pictures!P.S.It's free~REVIEW UPDATE~The 3.0 update came out, and Unturned's new Beta mode looks great! Nelson is making great progress on upping the ante. Unturned is really beginning to shape into a full game, very akin to Day Z with the backpack system. The game mechanics are different from the Alpha, including a ton of different skills. There is fishing now, in case hunting wasn't your thing, or you want to collect food without attracting too much attention but are too lazy to farm and settle. There is now a little bit of lore to how the apocalypse started, and the Canada map has been changed to PEI again. I have a feeling there will be exploration off of the island of PEI, but I haven't exactly gotten that far yet. (Still free, btw.) The crafting system has been greatly improved, where depending on you crafting level in the skill tree, having an item will automatically show you what you can craft with it, along with the other items also required. Unturned Beta shows even more promise than the Alpha did. Oh, and watch out for Mega Zombies. (Pro tip, use a gun) (Pro pro tip, when you don't have bullets, use a sledgehammer) (Pro pro pro tip, just run away, it's easier... sort of)",2015,2

Wasn't as large as I thought it would be, but it was large enough. Of course, we started gathering woods first, so we could have a shelter for the first night. Whereas my friend focused more on the framework, I focused more on making our shelter look pretty, by adding a Japanese-themed roof. Once we placed the last chair, the Guide rushed towards our newly made house and declared it his. Our first night wasn't bad. We just stayed inside, made a second floor while we were fighting off hordes of zombies, and eventually turned it into a temporary shooting range! So for the whole night, we shot zombies with our bows and arrows.The rest of the game was spent doing pretty much that. We collected woods (and sometimes stones), improved on our shelter (which eventually turned into a tower), and eventually mined. We kept mining a specific network, which in time lead us to the Underworld. Now mind you, we played on Hardcore. So if I died, then I die for good on that server. Anywho, our first trip to the Underworld wasn't too bad. We made a hellevator, and rode it down to the Underworld. We scouted for a bit, until we were attacked by demons. When we lost more that 50% of our health, we knew it was time to go back. And so, we teleported back home with our magic mirrors.So from that day forward, our mission was to mine the Hell out of Hell. Now this is where the story ends. I thought for sure that I would have died from a demon, or fell and slipped into lava, but no, it was from something else entirely. I decided to discover more of the network of caves, and hope to find treasure chests here and there. But no. I stepped on a pressure plate, and a boulder fell on me. I died, while my friend laughed and stole my items. That was when I stopped playing Terraria. Then update 1.3 came and I was like, ""Yipeee, I wonder what other deadl y contraptions Redigit has in store for me!""-pls excuse bad inggris.",2015,2

For those saying its just a glorified screensaver, to each their own. But make no mistake, there is actually quite a bit to do in Mountain.Looking out on the abyss in which your mountain floats is serene. Sometimes, terrifying, if your annihiliation is slowly flying towards you. Yes, it's not as flashy as COD, but I would take this over COD anyday. Just the quiet ambience, and the occasional lone, melancholy note signalling that your Mountain, this huge, hulking Mountain, has thought of something. Sometimes it reflects on the weather. Other times he expresses sadness and memories long forgotten. Controls-wise. Well, the music you can play. You can activate raging firestorms, fish, frogs, hearts, coins, or even blood. It all comes raining down upon your Mountain in a way that can be truly terrifying, engaging, or beautiful. Every now and again, your Mountain experiences a bit of cold weather, and snow comes down upon it, coating your little objects in white fluff. You can zoom in to examine these objects, these stray pieces of someone's or something's life, that come crashing into your Mountain from the cosmos. You can then move these objects, or feel joy/sadness as you purposefully/accidentally send them hurtling back into the void. You can express your distaste at clouds by waving your mouse wildly in defiance.The game is meant to be played when you want. I recommend checking up on it occasionally, but not actively playing if you don't feel like it. Check back if you hear the telltale ping of the Mountain's thoughts.The Mountain is thinking.

Further factions are unlockable following completion of the the Grand Campaign.Total War Kingdoms strongest feature is the real time battles, put a city under siege and send ladders to the wall or attack from afar with catapults, trebuchets and later in the game, powerful canons. Defend your town and cities with a well timed cavalry charge to disable enemy siege weapons and rain down flaming arrows upon the counter-attack.The ability to control each unit individually makes for practically unlimited strategy and the ability to destroy armies that on paper appear much stronger.The turn based city building side of the game also allows for a lot of strategic play, build advanced barracks, archery ranges and stables in castles, and increase revenue by upgrading towns to cities and so-forth.This mode can get a bit tedious in the later game simply because of the amount of organising necessary, but there are options to auto-manage these.Overall the balance between the slow pace of the city building mode and the fast real time battles is such that you can lose hours as your empire slowly gobbles up it's enemies and neighbouring factions. Addictive.The amount of forethought and planning reminds me of chess, in that you need to think a few turns ahead to make the most of your armies.8/10",2014,2

I like that though, because it reminds me it's just a game. Very realistic, havent played on ultra settings yet. 8/10Great graphics that will surely improve before the game is finished.Gameplay (Singleplayer)Some advice. Play singleplayer before multiplayer. On Multiplayer servers, all the good players are already in their own little cult, and the new ones dont want to group. Train a little here.With greatly adjustible settings, you can make it a noob's paradise, or a masochist's dream.Amazingly, the game isn't as boring as other singleplayer games I've played. With enough excitement, loot and crafting, it keeps you playing, even if it is just to learn. Howver, playing for long periods will get you bored.9/10Much less boring than expected. 'Nuff said.Gameplay (Multiplayer)More advice: Have friends who play the game. As I said, the good players are taken, and the noobs don't want to group. This is from personal experiance.Anyway, multiplayer gameplay is just like singleplayer, but with the excitement of base raiding, friendly communities and meetings. You marvel at the complex architechture of other people's bases, before falling into a spike trap. Happened to me once.Finally managing to gear up with help from an experianced player makes it so much more fun, and making daily loot runs is a great part of the game. However, there needs to be more player contact. I hardly see anyone, even on the big servers.9.5/10Brillant base building, exploring with friends and such. Needs more player contact.Gameplay (Other Notes)Here I'll talk about other intricacies of the wastelands, such as the zombies themselves, the crafting, and the base building.ZombiesStandard undead creatures. However, the devs had the great idea of having many variants of zombie all with different loot, such as nurses, which drop bandages and pills, etc. Combat feels comfortable, and weapon animations are realistic. However, Zombies are only difficult in hordes, that appear commonly if you're not careful. They're also pretty hard at night. Then, they Usain Bolt sprint everywhere, and are ridicously hard to deal with in even small numbers.Zombies+Combat9/10Easy-peasy combat with great variance in enemies. Difficulty increase at nighttime is original and creative.Specials.The game has a few 'special zombies' that you should be semi-afraid of.Bloated Zombie: Big, fat zombie that has way more health. Appears everywhere.Boomer Zombie: Same as Bloated, but can vomit acid that destroys everything in its path. Also explodes when you get too close. An actual threat, but only seems to appear uncommonly near the capital city.Zombie Dog: Rottweilers that easily outrun you and easily get you if you're not watching. Appears rarely in everywhere.Hornets: These are the scary ones. I've been freaked out when a hornet notices me, because I have a lot of difficulty killing them with melee and I can't waste bullets on them. At night, it freaks you out hearing that buzzing. Appears commonly near the hub city, but can appear anywhere.8/10Rare enough not to feel recycled, but there should be more types. Current ones are scary enough though.CraftingLoads, and Loads of different things to craft. Ranging from hoes to sniper rifles to forges, the recipes are easy to follow and resources are reasonably obvious to grab and use. Once you have the hang of it, basic recipes are memorized and used automatically when starting anew.10/10Fresh, realistic crafting system with loads of possibilities that leaves powerful items hard to get and essentials easy to make.Servers (I am droning on a bit. Sorry.)As an Australian, I'm pleased to have loads and loads and loads of low-ping servers (220 or so listed on the website server list.) Even playing with pings of 100 is absoultely fine, with lag only appearing around the 300 range. 10/10Easy to enter servers that are reliable and have a great community all round.That wraps up my second review. Conclusion:Buy the game, and nag your friends to buy it too. It's defintely worth its price of $25, and as it develops, it'll worth much more than that. If there's a sale, buy one for your friend as well.",2015,2

After all, I don't consider graphics to be super important like others do. But, when I first loaded it up, I was impressed. While not the flashiest and smoothest pictures ever, the environment still looks beautiful, one that prompts reflection on life when standing on top of the highest hill.What's great is that it is going to get better as time goes on.7.5/10Gamplay (Singleplayer)Singleplayer in zombie survival games never work out so well, because its such a depressing concept, being alone in the apocalypse. Plus its boring. However, Unturned somehow manages to turn SinglePlayer into a semi-enjoyable experiance, unlike many other games.I used it to learn the basics of crafting and building, but past that, I didn't play it.6.5/10Gameplay (Multiplayer)Well... First time encounter of a FRIENDLY player in zombie survival games. Depending on others to make the experiance better for everyone.Looting together, driving together, it all so fun. I have yet to participate in a drive-by shooting :P64 player servers on PEI map. Welcome to Unturned: FPS version. Fun as heck, encountering players every two minutes really does keep your guard up.However, loot scarceness on bigger servers needs to be improved. Competing with 63 other players for a can of cola is not as fun as it sounds.Thanks to my acquantinces Slip, Overlad1 and a couple of other peeps for hosting a private server for me.9/10 (Mainly due to  Friendlypocalypse :D)World DesignPrince Edward's Island is beautifully designed for travel, and lots of it. Towns made to seem real and like someone actually lived there once is a big plus.Storyline, even though so small, fits well with the map (Military destroy Confed. Bridge to stop spread, etc.)For some reason, I haven't found anything regarding the lore. More of that please :)8/10ConclusionUnturned is a great game if you need an alternative to DayZ (Because of DayZ's PEGI 18 rating. That's right kids.)Might want to hold off a week to wait for that big 3.0 update to finally arrive.imgoodatgaming, signing out.",2014,2

Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

Great combat, awesome seiges and you have to use a good degree of strategy to beat your opponenet, but what really make this game for me is the mods. The mods are the best, making total overhauls or just small adjustments. Its what makes this game long lasting for me. My favourite would be age of Petty Kings,  A Game of thrones mod. Great fun as i conquer my enemies and crush their skulls. The generals also have alot of character as they evolve over    your playthrough. The spearmen are op and you can basically destroy anything with them with minimal loses in my playthrough.

Life Is Feudal is by far one of the BEST sandboxes ive ever played. Its got unique systems and mechanics for crafting, forging, cooking, alchemy and other things like terraforming and logging. ALL of which have their own skill sets and levelling so you won't progess skills the same way twice, or find the same items & ingredients in the same place which is a nice touch. Depending on which server you are on, there are also variable stat & skill caps this means that if you specialise in a certain skill it can determine how useful you will be in building settlments, and once reach the leveling limit of one skill, thats it Reach the stat and skill caps and leveling up will be a distant memory as they will become rare occurences. This means prople of different skills will have to work together and pool resources and skills, especially if a battle takes place in nearby settlements/towns and repairs have to be made quickly. For example, one person of your group/guild might be a master blacksmith, while another will be a master Logger, so choosing which skill to level completely is CRUCIAL.You basically start the game with nothing but food scraps and rags for clothes, so your first instinct is to create primitive gear which can be done quite quicker than you would expect. As you start to meet random people in your travels, you will also start to learn of the surrondings more and where developments have been started. I remember one time where I spawned into the world and I basically turned right and saw an ENTIRE FORTRESS built far off into the distance on the other side of an island, and as I explored around there was the odd camp/shack then a small town where groups have formed a guild. It cleary shows the sheer scope of how important working with people is in this game.Another strong point is the combat mechanics, if you have played the Mount & Blade games you will feel right at home here with the directional movements and there are even group formations to be used in a battle! Formations like shield walls, phalanx/wedge, and defensive circle formations can be applied and changed on the fly in mid battle, VERY useful for when 2 armies or more are battling it out.The final thing you will notice (and the most notable when you start the game and spawn into a world) is the graphics. At the moment there are Direct x 7 and 9 graphics, DO NOT let the discussions and reviews fool you! This game is a visual master piece considering the DX7 and 9 graphics closely resemble TES4: Oblivion's graphics, but with the fast approaching release date the Direct x 11 graphics will make this one of the most beautiful medieval themed sandboxes ever made!Overall i give this game a 8.5/10 and thats just at an EARLY ACEESS point of veiw as Bitbox are at the moment of smoothing everything out for the release and beginning to implement future features upon post release. This has been one of the most comprehensive, immersive and challenging games ive played to date. Looking forwand to more! 11/10 would recommend this game to those who have never played sandboxes or similar themed games like MMORPG's as it is worth the experience.",2015,2

If you're a fan of either of these titles, then this should definitely be on your list.Unlike Terraria or Minecraft however, it feels more like a game that has a plot and creates a desire to continue and develop that is otherwise absent in the previously mentioned titles. Minecraft (Vanilla) for instance, has it's good points (it's huge Modification base being a big plus), but it's lack of tutorial and strong desire to complete the game lead many players into the deadly cycle of explore, build impenetrable fortress, get bored, explore...Starbound is not without flaw however. It's still very much in development, so ignoring bugs and graphics issues, there is a huge level of potential for this title. With an engaging and well thought out game base, you are able to explore and progress smoothly. Simple old styled graphics, with coding for a more recent era of Sandbox styled games. For now, the bugs and glitches make it difficult to truly appreciate this game, but, once many coding has been sorted out and finalized ... Starbound looks to be a very impressive experience.PROS: Easy to learn. Huge degree of customization. Character creation. Fantastic soundtrack. Randomly generated landscapes and Mobs. Expansive environment (both is space and on-planet) Co-operative and PVP Multiplayer. Upgradeable Character CONS: Frame rate issues, highly buggy on some PC's, and programming conflicts (Development). Certain areas are too easy, some are too hard (Balance). Some bosses become a ""find the exploit' battle. Drag and drop inventory can be frustrating.OVERALL: 7 / 10 (Based on current version)",2013,2

You can still spend money, but it all goes to cosmetics, so the only factor that differs between players is their skill level.Just a quick thing, the community. The community in csgo is massive, and of course it has its ups and downs. All communities have toxic players, hackers, scammers etc, as well as helpers and friendly players. But the one thing that strikes me about this game, is that the devs gave it to us, and we figured it out from there. We discovered bhopping, trading techniques and heaps of other stuff, and that is what really strikes me about this game, its that we as a community, figured this game out for ourselves, and even found some things that the devs didnt.Third, the skins. Now personally I dont see why you would spend hundreds of dollars on an item with no beneficial value whatsoever, but thats just me. But apart from that, the skins are actually a way of making money if you know how to trade. You can go from bloody 4 cent skins to a 100 dollar knife without spending a single cent on the way! (P.S never open cases, they are a complete waste of time and money).If you can get past the toxic players, the hackers, the smurfs, the scammers, the glitches and the plenty of other issues in the game, its a blast.Good luck!",2015,0

For example i really like American Locomotives but am not much of a fan on European Locomotives, I can then go through and see that many suit my taste and are not bundled with European locomotivesPlus there is a Giant modding community which have made their own locomotives and freight, as well as scenery for the map editorOverall, This game isn't perfect but it is fun",2015,2

When I saw Skyrim I thought “This will be a great game cough cough”. So we plug it in and gave it a whirl and I watched for about an hour.  After that it was my turn. I instantly fell in love with the game and after quite a while the terrain in the ps3 started flashing blue and then about one minute later the ps3 shut down from overheating. After 2 days he left and I convinced josh into buying it. After a while the ps3 broke and that was the end of that. But then I got it on computer and the story continued and this time with mods. All in all a wonderful game filled with mystery and adventure. A unique leveling system and many quests, the wide range of weapons will keep you striving for a higher dps. The hunt to kill dragons in order to become a more powerful warrior is thrilling and fun. The dlcs will give you even more content and lore.  The open world is also great because as you cross the vast plains or mountains areas of Skyrim you come across little areas that have been put there out of thought.  In the latest update they added  legendary difficulty which has made the game even better, making it feel like they need a dragonborn to protect them. This is an absolute terrific game and once you play it you’re going to come back. Defiantly a ten out of ten from me.",2014,2

Purely atmospheric, with some very appealing lighting and graphics. There is little to no music in the game, leaving you walking through a quiet and somewhat eerie area. Even so, this sets a perfect atmosphere, calmly, yet it still keeps you on your nerves.Admittedly, the story is somewhat cliché, but is still portrayed quite well. As you progress through new areas, you meet a few new people who give you small tasks that help you towards getting off of the stranded island you are on, with an unknown company blocking any outer communication. These characters are not always friendly, some attempting to kill you, just trying to survive in this perilous land. The voice actors are brilliant, bringing life to the game and to the characters they play.The graphics in this game are, while not perfect and somewhat buggy, still quite beautiful. There were multiple occasions where I would sit there for a few minutes and gaze out into the virtual horizon, taking in the quiet beauty. The lighting used in the maps are just worthy of a comment in itself. Dark areas have a dark glow to them, while the happier, lighter areas have a nice bright tinge to them. The infected are somewhat bland, looking as though they came from Star Trek and just have glowing yellow eyes, but they don't pose a threat, they are more there to remind you of the reason that you are there.As a total game, I found this to be quite impressive. I HIGHLY recommend this game to those with a passion for atmosphere. Considering this was made with the HL2 engine and is only the first Act of many to come, I can only wait in anticipation for the next few Acts. This game has impressed me quite a lot, with it unique atmosphere and dramatic music. As a total, this game brings back what was missing in the gaming community; Atmosphere. Modern games incorperate as much action as they can, sometimes not letting you take a break and take it all in, but this game let's you play and take it in at the same time. Very impressed with this game, can't wait for the next Acts.",2014,2

But there are some major flaws that sometimes makes people slam their computer and swear like a mad man (me). First of all, there are only a limited amount of missions. Waaaay les than what happened in the war. Second of all, the path finding of the troops are just fustrating. As I mentioned, I slammed my computer because they couldn't get around a bridge. Thrid, the troops can't fight! They go up to the enemy, fire a few shots, but they can't hit anything! And then they get decimated by the enemy. Third of all, I was in the situation. The enemy hides behind sandbags and my pz III fires a HE round at them. The round does nothing. But then, 5 minutes later, a M8 Greyhound comes in, and it does everything to my panzergrenedire troops. They fell down because a HE round landed 5 meters from him. IT KOCKED HIM OVER. AND HE COULDN'T FIRE PANZERFAUST. Now that is most annoying thing ever. If the enemy can take direct hits from HE, why can't I???? Either way great game. WAAAY better than Company of Heroes 2.

A few things were a bit of a let down. For example, you claim to be a ""vigilante"" but really you are just a criminal that occasionally does something good. The hacking itself is pretty basic, but plays with some interesting ideas. You really do feel like you have power over the city and it makes the game really enjoyable. The combat system is really simple and a bit annoying, but it does what it needs to do well. The game looks ok, but I have to run it on high/medium settings, so it's more my fault than the game's. There is a LOT to do that will keep you entertained, but sometimes the side quests that pop up on the screen can get a bit annoying. The multiplayer is good but a little lacking. I would have loved to see a open world multiplayer where you can do whatever you want with your friends in this amazingly open world. Overall a really good game, one of my favourites already. I can see myself playing it for a long time. As for a rating, well maybe around an 8/10 for me. I was really looking forward to being a bringer of justice, but I was let down as it feels like another GTA with a bit of crime stopping.",2014,2

The game isnt about unlocking guns and huge as scopes and all of that crap, it cuts strate to the chase ( you all have the same pool of weapons, they, theres nothing in the game that can give you an advantage  exept yourself) CS:GO provides more than just better graphics than its previous versions, it provides a variety of game modes that everyone can have fun in, more guns, and of course more nades. It is also a very balanced game in which there are no cheat guns and if you die it was probably your fault or u just got caught at close range with a sniper, but that said you should be able to kill your opponent at close range with your sniper if your good enough. There are still some things that CS:GO might have to improve on, but these things are things that all fps games suffer from such as campers and hackers, that nothing valve can do will stop them, ussually there are no hackers in your game, it is very rare for u to come by one if u play on official servers because of the vac (valve anti cheat) program.

For me, this game seemed like an experiment, a way to make people think about how something that we see as insignificant in our everyday life can be percieved as a subject of philosophical debate. Cutting all of that sophisticated sounding stuff out, just wow. I started playing the game and noticed that you only had 2 options in the menu, Start and Exit... No Options, No Credits, Not even a Help button, Just Start and Exit. The game doesn't give you instructions and it doesn't hint at places, It just simply asks whether you want to play or not. Now for people who don't really understand how texts can hold hidden meanings, (i.e. People who haven't been bored out of there life listening to shakespeare in High School or haven't figured it out already), this might seem like a 5 minute game where they put extreme details into the animations of a fly.

Civilisation V is the type of game that one plays when they have a few hours to spare, each session lasting between 5-10 hours, sometimes even 20. Although this may seem quite daunting to those who haven't experienced the joy of defeating barbarians that have ravaged your land and taken your workers for over 1000 years, the game is captivating enough to make time fly, literally ingame and out, as in 1 turn is 100 years, get it... Bad jokes aside, the game is designed brilliantly, containing beautiful graphics, allowing players to view the board in a 3d or strategic way. When you first load up the screen and you see buttons and words on all 4 sides of the display, don't be discouraged by this, I will admit that for a board game, it has far more mechanics then one would normally expect, including things such as technology trees, policies, productions, settling, etc. the list could go on forever! But these rules and ideas can be picked up pretty quickly, seeing as how you will be playing it for many hours, and this allows for another aspect of the game, Discovery. You will find that initially the map will seem quite small, sometimes even wondering 'How are we gonna spead out and conquer the world with this minute amount of land'. But as you start building troops and scouts and boats, you quickly realize how small your city is compared to the land that awaits you, granted the map size and pace of the game can all be changed in the game settings. The multiplayer mode can also be one of the most ridiculous (in a good way) way of finding out the true nature of your friends, whether it be through them starting a war with you, forming an alliance, plotting with you to backstack some other poor friend that you both think might win the game. The multiplayer mode, I have found, becomes a better tutorial than the tutorial that the game has to offer, allowing you to learn faster with a person that know the rules and can interact with you as opposed to the AI that pops up messages every so often that tells you the obvious. Caution: If you're playing this at night with some friends over voice chat, remember to close your door as you will find yourself shouting and yelling. Why? well you'll have to play to find out...Overall, this game will not disappoint you, introducing new mechanics and ideas every step of the way, straining and developing your brain as you panic over losing money and resources, essentially plonking you in a position of a world leader and seeing how far you can make your civilastion survive. I recommend this game to everyone of all ages, if they're looking for a relaxed way to spend their day, but if your looking for fast action, FPS, bloodsplattery goodness, you might want to try something else.",2013,2

I mostly play competetive and deathmatch, but there's also other modes such as casual if you don't want to be involved in ranks or waiting for the 20 hour cool down after playing too much competetive.Don't get intimidated by the fact of buying guns and knives, because they are simply just skins and don't give the player that spent $400 on a knife any advantage over the player that spent $0. However the cool thing about steam is being able to sell cards and other items which you can use to purchase weapons or buy crates and keys to have a chance to win better guns and knives.You do get a few hackers and afk players every know n' then but they are easily kicked with the easy team voting system. The main problem I have is smurfs, which are players that make other accounts and may seem as a low rank but actually have a higher rank making them unfair as they play with lower ranks even though they are much more skilled.Finally gamplay, the gameplay is very smooth and well thought out. Low rank players play with low rank players and high rank players play with high rank players. All guns have their advantages and disadvantages such as long range, short range, recoil, damage, fire rate and accuracy. Each map has well placed objects which can be used as cover.Overall this game is a MUST! I reccommend cs:go to any fps gamer or even any average gamer in general.",2015,0

Rikimaru can be countered with wards/dust/gem and really squishy in early game, but in low ranked games people dont know that. They usually just stay there getting xp and then when riki blinked strike them, they run away and let riki get fat.  I really suggest nerfing riki a little bit early game just to make him really squishy. Make him not and easy hero too. Nerf his skill a  little bit so people dont always win after getting a fat riki.

Pre Patch 1.37 - 7-8/10Patch1.37 - /10Patch 1.37 was supposedly to make the game better in the way it was more balance, haha infact it made it worse. throught my few hours playing the game after patch 1.37 I have come to believe that Gaijan have become greedy ( Like activision/treyarch) in the ye old days like 1.29 you could quite easly come out of a match making around 10-20K profit depending on whether you have premium or not. I not saying this because im bad but here are 3 reasons why Gaijin had screwed up the game after Patch 1.37:1. Matchmaking-After 10 games in the new patch im not sure if it was unlucky or absoluty garbage. I prefer to play in the british line up while using stuff like the Wellington, beaufighters ect. the problem I was having is I would get over the bombing target in my Wellington Ic and then be killed by 8 Fighters who can climb to your altitude within a matter of minutes, which resulting into easy kills.Aircraft have now been sorted in tiers rather than ranks, you may think that is true but infact its the complete opposite. the aircraft may be a tier 3 but the battle rating (Which can be found while hovering over the aircraft) is the acctually ""Ranked"" lobby you will be put in, for example the Mustang Mk1a which is a british fighter is a tier 4 but its battle rating is 5.3. they say they would be changing this but can we really believe them?!?2. Leveling up-Prier to patch 1.37 if the people who are reading this just started you had ranks rather than tiers. like any game you get kills = lions+Xp = more aircraft = kills... which was all good you could quite happly level up, now you need to research the aircraft. the developers said this new system would acctually help you unlock aircraft quicker... Wrong, infact it would take you 4-5x long to get a single plane in the game. for example the F80C shooting star you need 320000RP to unlock, if you get an average of  1-3k RP for that aircraft (Note not all RP earned in a game goes towards an aircraft, the rest is stored so you can use it later but there is a twist) it would take you atleast 100-150 games to unlock, and a normal game goes for 20 mins((20x150)/3=1000/24=41) so it would take you around 1-2 days of non stop gameplay to unlock it. LIES!!!!3-""Pay to play""as this person has explained Beautifully on the War thunder Forums""So let me sum up it here. Instead of playing and enjoying the game Gaijin wants the players to   1)Buy gold 2)Buy premium 3) Play the game a lot 4) Realize you can't do it without premium aircraft, buy premium aircraft 5) Lose your xxx on repair bills because you can't use your fully upgraded lower planes for higher level plane research xp. 6) Use your golden eagles to buy lions at exorbitant rates. 7) Rinse and repeat. Stop locking these threads, people need to know what Gaijin did.  Stop censoring the threads mods, your job is not censor the posts of the paying members and communities response. We all know the mods are purposely locking these threads trying to downplay the community response to this patch which is designed for one reason and  one reason only, to make the game take much longer and force a whole lot more golden eagle purchases.   We are not stupid, we can see right through you."" - Digital Zombielink - http://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/89224-research-really/as you can see Gaijin have become so full of themselfs they cant control what they have become without starting over. many people would agree that dont waste your time on this game till they get there ♥♥♥♥ together!.Regards ShiftY_.",2013,2

Life Is Strange puts the player in the main character's place in a similar way that some of Quantic Dream's games do, but it does this more humbly; you won't be rushed into making life-changing decisions that you can't rewind (because, of course, you can rewind). The game throws quite a few tough decisions at you, but it gives you all the time you want to decide which one you want to choose. In this manner, the game makes you feel like more of an experimenting onlooker than actually being in the game. The premise is pretty ridiculous (how to entropy??), but that's not the point. Like those ""would you rather..."" questions (and movies like Groundhog Day), it makes you ponder and imagine, while also giving you the thrill of seeing the outcomes of your hypothetical/real decisions. The story can be a bit predictable at times (even before you go back in time) and a few characters are very stereotypical, but nonetheless, it is a good story with fairly good character development. It explores many themes quite well, including love, friendship, depression, and self-exploration.Playing Life Is Strange is like looking through a camera: you're there, but not really part of the action when you hold the camera. You have to decide which moment you want to capture. Once you've decided, you take the shot and that moment is recorded, and you wonder how well it will turn out.

This time was well spent as I was playing so much better than some players that went directly to multiplayer, for new players, offline bots do help a lot!Now I was up to the stage where I felt that I needed that Paid-to-Play (PTP). So I went ahead and got it. The second I got that PTP it opened up so much more of TF2 than what it was like before PTP, however, after finding my first hat, PTP TF2 players will find that TF2 was almost a man's dressup game or as most people would call it now, a hat simulator. As PTP, it is important that you don't get fustrated when you don't get stuff you want even though you find items about 15-50% faster than Free-to-Play (FTP) users.Then it happens again, but this time you unboxed your first unusal. Everything changes again and the game becomes much more exiting, I found that most players that have unusals (kind of going to use a common FTP reference) like to train and become better at that specific class. As FTP, you will see peeople wearing those unusals and become either jealous, fustrated that they are so good and sometimes call them hackers (and who knows, maybe they are hacking?).But overall, you can worry about how good you look, but just look good in those Freeze Cam and show how good looking you are, but that shouldn't stop you actuly being a FTP and playing the game even though you are PTP.Lastly what you should note about TF2 is that it isn't repetive like some games like Neverwinter etc. There is always going to be new players with new styles of gameplay that makes this game very interesting too, reguard less if they are PTP or FTP.My final thoughts? This game is great, also makes a good time killer if you have some spare time on your hands. This game can keep you hooked for hours on hand, and as PTP, you do a lot of trading, so sometimes is good to watchout for scamers or people in high demand for something. In addtion, this game is extreamly good looking as well, in both gameplay and graphics. TF2 is going to be a hard one to beat!~ 9/10",2014,2

The game is fun at the start and you get to know the basics. But after finishing the turtorial and a few other levels of beating other player's castles it starts to get repeative. Litterally all there is to it is fighting th same castle over and over and over. All because it takes forever to level up your character and castle. I wish I could recommend this game, but there just need to be a bit more varaity in castle making. Another thing is that the game takes way too long to play, you could play this game for a full straight 24 hours and to Ubisoft, its absolutly no progress...

The first game was great but never realised its full potential. The second game prove to out perform the first and is regarded as a high for the series. This makes the thrid game in the arkham series 'Origin', to be very similar to Assassins creed brotherhood. Although it couldn't be said that these are worst than thier predecessor, neither of these games really offer any ground breaking innovation to the series. let's break Arkham origins down game down into some key compenets and compare it arkham city.Firstly the environment, The Map in Arkham origins is considerably larger than in arkham city , giving you access to what is apparently the whole of Gotham City. Despite its size however its a pretty dull map. one third of the map looks like it has been commped and pasted from Arkham city, another third consistes of a collosal bridge which you have to cross every time you want to get to the other halve of gotham, unless you use the new 'quick travel system'. This leaves only one third of the map that is new, which is fairly dissapointing. The developers have added the bat cave, however this only serves as an access point to ranked challenges and training exercises and you only interact with in a couple times in the main campaign.Speaking of the main campaign, the story line of Arkham origins is as expected top notch. The only criticism I can think of has  to do with some of the villian. firstly some of them are rather obscure. I know some die-hard batman fans will know who some of they are, but if the majority of people have to wikipedia half of the villians in a batman game, it means your scraping the bottom of the barrel. Secondly you only fight most the villians once and then thats it. Deathstroke for instance was the first of the 8 announced assassins for the game and there was a considerably amount of hype about the fight between him and Batman. They when you get to the game you fight him in one boss fight and then he is totally defeated. These assassins are suppose to be the best in the world and are getting paid $50 MILLION to kill the batman, yet all of them seem to lack the tenacity and motivation to try more than once to kill batman. The reason behind this I believe is because the developers are trying to cram the entire storyline into the time frame of one single night, surely stretching it out to a week or at least a  couple of nights wouldn't kill the plot. Finally there is the combat which for the most part is left untouched and retains most of its inherit awesomeness. The developers worked off the idea that 'why fix something that isn't broken' and instead opted to simply make the combat 'different'. This has ment the implementation of three new mobs to beat up: The martial artist, who is basically a regular mob that requires more countering in order to defeat; The Venom thug, essentially a mini Bane, where you have to disable his venom pack before beating him to a pulp; And finally the Enforcer thug, who act like the Abramovici brother in arkham city only sometimes the have armour which you need to remove, before you take them down. there are also some new gagdets that can be employeed in combat such as the shock gloves and the ability to do two special combo moves, however this only makes the fighting eaiser as this give the player a very easy way to beat all the mobs that are support to make the game difficult. There are also some gadgets such as the remote claw and the glue grenade which are exact ripp offs of the line launcher and freeze grenades, respectively.Yet another similarity that Arkham origins has with Assassins creed Brotherhood is the fact that it is the first in its series to introduce multiplayer. This consists of a 3v3v2 system where two gangs (Jokers and Banes) fight over 3 control point while a third team of Batman and Robin (which is unusualy as Robin is not featured in the main game) attempt to takedown the teams siently, in order to build up an intimidation metre and scare the thugs away. Although this is a fairly unique game concept it is at the best of times glitchy. FPS aspect of the game is somewhat stale and ins't terribly exciting. The matchmaking system is fast to get you into a game, but you often have to wait for the nesicarry 8 people to join before the game starts. Despite the fact that 8 people have to be in the game in order for it to start, there always seems to be two or three people that leave the game while its loading, usually resulting in on team having an unfair advantage over the over. This is particularly noticeable when the super villians become avaliable for either villian team to grab. unless the hero team or the disadvantaged villian team is really good, the team with the most numbers will generally gain access to their teams villians, which are considerably over powered . One game it took my team 4 lives to kill an enemy Joker and I have yet to see anyone successfully kill Bane. There is also a system where you can buy, with either in game or real world money booster backs. This in itself is a sin considering I already bought the game. It is more so a sin when the game suddenly desides to wipe all your statistics including your level, unlocks and purchased goodies!In Final Summation, Batman arkham city is indeed a good game by most standards and arguably it is as good as Arkham City , however it is certainly not any better than arkham city and leaves a lot for the next arkham title to rectify. In my opinion however Batman Arkham Origins is still a worthwhile game with pleanty of the unadulterated goodness that makes the Arkham series of of the best in its genre.          7.5/10",2014,2

I paused the game and stood away from my computer for a good 5 mins, just thinking abou where I went wrong. 2nd attempt (Which is still going at time of review) and I made it to day 9 without anything going wrong, but then that night, I went a little bit too far. My main scavenger was raiding a house with people in it, and I was trying to sneak past, but then I was spotted. One of them had a shotgun, and shot my scav, seveirly wounding him. I hid him in the basement, and let him rest. He couldn't get out. Then the person with the Shotty came down the ladder, and I clobbered her with my hatchet. The other two in the house were un-armed, but I killed them anyway. By the time I had gotten the shotgun, it was 20mins till dawn, and I wasn't getting out in time. He had arrived home that afternoon, but was leathaly wounded and broken. I had one of my guys talk him back into life, and give him some canned food. But...I had no bandages, and didn't have the means to make any. For three nights, I went Searching places for bandages. Even went to the hospital, but they wouldn't help. That night, my main scavenger died from his wounds.I give this game a 9.5/10 on the feel raiting, and a 9/10 on the game itself.~Vri",2015,0

So there is an added bonus to play with friends!Cons:Houses - Building structures for houses are really expensive. Especially if you have a low gathering speed on the server properties, just trying to build a wall could take you maybe 5 minutes?Leveling - Since i play on an Unofficial server it was not long ago that i found out the unofficial servers have a lower experience rate, hence if you do play i suggest when making a server to raise up the expResource - Collecting resources take forever! as i said buildng a structure takes 5 minutes for 1 wall just by UPing the gathering speed to lets say 3x makes a world of a difference, though keep in mind its a little OP against trees.Dino Agro - Even though the game is designed to play alongside dino's I cannot stress at how much i hate certain dino's such as the spinosaur! its equivalent to a ""creeper"" in ""minecraft"" for me.Combat - Combat depending on how good your internet is or what server you're playing on, can either be okay, or SUPER LAGGY! though i am now playing on my friends server i don't experience combat fighting issues.Solo - The game is EXTREMELY boring playing by yourself. IMOFirst spawn - There is no tutorial on how to do things, so it is really confusing on how to learn to do anything, hence it is not very ""noob"" friendly, It took me a while to make anything lol.Interface - The interface to your inventory or crafting system can be improved, imo its very confusing for me, though you get used to it, it took a while and everything is scattered everywhere.TL;DRIf you want to play this game, make sure you:Host a serverPlay with friendsUP the EXP and Gathering RatesWatch a how to start off in ARK videoENJOY :D",2015,0

Some missions are for the sneaky, some for the control freaks and yet more for the just plain blood thirsty. The missions are short yet engaging, the atmosphere fun rather than immersive, and the rewards simple: More money, more guns and more masks. Yes, masks are a thing. You would have thought they were just there to hide your face wouldn't you? And you would be wrong.... but don't think about it for now.Now it should be pointed out that you can solo this game, but the AI is pretty bad in loud missions and the game really rewards playing with friends especially on the higher difficulty levels. But probably the best thing about this game is the community and the development team for the game. There are constant updates and new heists, new weapons, new skills and even new faces. Some of these will cost you, and some are free, but in the end for the sheer amount of time I have spent in this game, and the fun I have had, this game and all its DLC have been superb value for money."" - Gopher (YouTuber/LiveStreamer)Sums it up well :)",2015,2

First one to take down the enemy's Ancient (final, large building) wins), and one of the most popular (second only to League of Legends).It is very similar to LoL (although there is no 'surrender' feature in normal games - yet), and if you play LoL or most other MOBAs I can guarantee you'll have a good time in Dota 2, provided you can get over the difficulty.The difficulty in Dota 2 is much higher than other games of the same genre. League can be quite easy, but Dota is a complete other world, where if you don't do even the smallest split second thinking right, it can cost an entire teamfight and then lead to defeat. Don't let this scare you though, practising against bots will allow you to get ability and item combinations down pat.Although, if you've never played a MOBA before, it may take a while to learn. As well-known Dota 2 player Purge says, it will take about 2-3 months before you'd be considered 'ok' or 'decent'. Along side this difficulty in game is the players. Sometimes you'll get really nice players that joke around a bit, sometimes you'll get nice competitive players, sometimes you'll get people who joke around the entire game to annoy their team...but sometimes you'll get players who want nothing but perfection (I myself, at times, may be one of these people) and detriment their own team if the smallest thing isn't done correctly. There is a reason behind this, which is like I've meantioned before, even the slightest wrongdoing (tower diving for a kill A.K.A. suiciding - but this is quite a large example).The Heroes (not Champions) you get to play as are all given to you at the start, rather than 'buying' or unlocking them. Although this may seem like all the new players would get to play the best Heroes from the start, there isn't exactly a 'best Hero'. Heroes have many, many downsides and weaknesses, and if not played well can lead to some of those problems I've mentioned above. Once a Hero is learnt to play well though, it is possible to effectively dominate the enemy team when playing on pubs (casual servers). Beware when going into ranked matches though - most people in ranked will know how to play and what to do, as it requires a fair amount of playing to unlock 'ranked'. I myself unlocked it in ~120 games, which was for me 240 hours of playing the game.Overall, this is a great Free-To-Play game that is definitely worth getting. It's free after all, and it isn't a small game, unlike some F2P games that have next to no content or games that need to have most of the content bought to be able to use it and actually have fun in the game. It isn't Pay-To-Play in the slightest, as the only thing money can buy is extra looks for Heroes, Wards, HUDs, Couriers, and Loading Screens. There are about 10,000,000 regular users and counting. How about you join them?I'd give this game a 9.5/10, maybe even a 10 because of a Hero that is afraid of trees.Rizzrack/10, I love you Timbersaw (http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Timbersaw <-- Hero referenced).",2014,2

I came across it accidentally sometime in 2015 when it was on sale, and decided to purchase it just from looking at the trailer. It looked amazing, and it definitely didn't disappoint. It wasn't until I had beaten the game that I found out it was quite popular, so I'm glad that I could form my own opinions on the game before reading anyone else's.The graphics and artstyle are amazing. The story is so moving for something so simple. Many hidden places and easter eggs. Out of 10, I'd give it a 9. The only downside I can think of for this gem of a game would be that you cannot return to some places after the story has continued, meaning that there may be a few things you have missed and can't return to (a little annoying when it comes to achievements). Overall, definitely a worthy purchase (I haven't bought the definitive edition yet, update to come once I try it).",2015,2

For anyone who like realistic FPS games with a bit of fun, this is where you should go. It started off as a Half-Life 2 mod, but the fan base grew so it became its own game. This is one of the few Free-To-Play games on Steam that are a must-have, just because of its simplicity!I won't go into much detail, but this game is like a classic Shoot 'Em Up game, except with a realist element added in. There are a variety of very different maps, and more to come in future updates. The game is being updated regularly, so don't worry about any bugs the game might have, they get patched quickly.The combat is fairly balanced (besides maybe running around with a hatchet), unless you come across an experienced player. There are a variety of weapons, ranging from pistols, to shotguns, to rifles, to fists and legs. There are some weapons that are extremely unfair, for example the Sniper Rifle or Colt Walker, but they are much harder to get. There are 3 different kinds of chests, each with their own level of weapons inside. There are blue chests (low-tier),  red chests (mid-tier) and gold chests (top-tier; also where the Sniper Rifle and Colt Walker meantioned before are kept). This chests restock with weapons after a little period of time. Each map has its fair share of chests, but beware. It takes time to open them, and you must be standing near it for this to happen. This also means you cannot move or attack when opening a chest, which leaves you vulnerable for attacks from other players. If the weapon take is successful on the other hand, it gives a noticable advantage when compared to the starting weapons. To heal health, there are whiskey bottles that respawn once drinken, but they leave a kind of tipsy effect on your character for a few seconds, where aiming is a bit off.Overall, this game is definitely worth getting (I mean it's free, come on; there are no in-game purchases either), and I'd give it an 8/10.",2014,2

I always thought it was weird to play a game like this and whenever I saw gameplay videos of Dota 2 - I had no idea what the heck was going on. It never occured to me though, that this game would have baited me in for more hours of playtime. When I first started Dota, there were some training missions I had to go through. These explained the basics pretty well to me and eventually, I thought I knew what I was doing. Also, I also thought there would've been some sort of story mode (Due to the way the training was presented). Unfortunately, there was none but I could see some potential for a story-like mode.Although during my first public matchup, I did feel like quiting because I really did have no idea what I was doing and my ""teammates"" were complaining about how bad I was TO THE OTHER TEAM (That's right; the other team/our enemies). Then they all began calling me a noob. The amount of insults I received were terrible, but eventually I had a few other friends play the game along with me and that's when things began to change. That's when Dota 2 became something I actually loved to play because of friends, and because my friends and I got better. It came to a point when we started to insult the enemy team whenever we trashed them. Everytime we do that, it would just end up with us having fun regardless of us winning or not. That's what Dota 2 is for me: having a good time with friends and having fun.I then tried LoL and I came to the conclusion:Dota 2 > LoLSo since this game is free to play, I highly recommend it. It's free so I say, ""Why not?"". It's best played with people you know, after all- it is a team based game. There are more things to talk about in Dota, but if you want to know what they are, play the game. Experience it.",2013,2

Because it serves its purpose of making you choose how you'd like to play. From stealthing your way through a whole section, taking down badguys behind every corner, or going guns blazing- killing every one in sight; it's one of those games where choice is present. Although there may be choice, it does not affect your character or story (unfortunately). I played through this game twice and had fun playing it over again just to get the achievements. The game itself has a wonderful story; one that opens its way into the earlier Deus Ex games. There are plenty of easter eggs from the previous game to be found here since this is chronologically a prequel to the other Deus Ex games. It was definitely thrilling towards the end where different endings appeared. I saved it at the time to make sure I went across each ending and those endings gave the game justice. I couldn't stop the goosebumps from popping out.All in all, if there ever was a chance to get Deus Ex:HR - get it. Make sure it's the Director's Cut too because then you'd have the DLC (Missing Link) implemented in as well as for a few more added features. If not, just get the game regardless.",2014,0

Even the game not having a campaign to get more interesting, it's exclusively focused to the cooperative (against AI-controlled bots) and to the Multiplayer (against real enemies).Entering the game, the player can choose to join the Insurgents team or to the Security team, both have their own classes, weapons and customizations, but even so, the game can keep very well balanced during the match.Currently, Insurgency has 7 different game modes in the Multiplayer, which the maximum server capacity is 32 players, about the cooperative match, the game has 5 different modes and the maximum server capacity is 8 players.GRAPHICS: As for the graphics we can say that is impressive to see how developers worked to optimize them to the maximum, even with many elements present during a match the game doesn't need a very good PC to run, the graphics stand out for being well modeled and with a excellent finish, the details of the scenarios and weapons also impresses, but it is impossible to compare them to new generation of games, I think the graphics are similar to CS:GO. There are some mods at Steam Workshop that can slightly improve the graphics of the game.SOUNDS / AUDIOS: Another extremely positive point of Insurgency is the quality of the sounds of weapons, environments and explosions, they can make you get fully into the game, because it seems that you are in a real war, and also, you can download some mods in Steam Workshop that will improve the effect and the experience, letting the game more real (or funny). PING / FPS: The game has a really good rendering which makes it possible to run even on less powerful computers (if you can run CS:GO on low graphics at 60 FPS, probably can play Insurgency without any problem), and servers respond very well, even with 200 ping, you can play without perceive any difference or interference while the gameplay.GAMEPLAY: The gameplay of Insurgency is a bit different because it tends to the realism, so it becomes a bit more complicated than other FPS games we are used to, always being very fluid and responding well to the requested commands. If you are new to FPS games, maybe you will pass a bit of difficulty, 'cause you don't have a quick answer against enemies or even an advanced coverage notion yet. To the veterans on FPS games can be sure that Insurgency will make you become better at basically every other FPS you play or have played.The physics in the game is a little weak, it tries to hide some mistakes but it doesn't work so much, for example the bodies don't react too well to bullets.I didn't find any individual cheating, or doing some bug.DEVELOPERS: Assets and attentive, the Insurgency Support/Development Team is an example, always trying to help you with any questions or problems you have in the game, unlike many other games, the Developer/Support Community of Insurgency tries to maintain a intense contact with the public, as an example, they play matches with us. You can contact them through Steam if you need something, which makes the service be much faster and easier.COMMUNITY: In the sense of Insurgency Players Community, I can not analyze in relation to Asian, Oceania or Africa servers, but the American (all the America, not only U.S.A.) and Europe community are very warm and friendly (also very funny, ALLAHU AKBAR) at every match that I played I didn't find any rager or any that harm your gameplay (such as abusing the voice chat, abusing the chat, or kill his own team with intent). The players community created and are creating a lot of mods to improve or vary your gameplay (some mods are very hilarious), also the artworks and screenshots created from players are very cool.Análise em PortuguêsReview on PortugueseRESUMO: Insurgency é um jogo FPS (First-Person Shooter) tático com elementos que tendem para o realismo porém podem ser configurados para deixá-lo bem arcade (isso dependendo do servidor). Mesmo com o jogo não tendo uma campanha para ficar mais interessante, a sua proposta é exclusivamente focada para o cooperativo (contra Bots controlados por IA), e para o Multiplayer (contra inimigos reais). Ao entrar na partida, o jogador poderá escolher entre se unir ao time de Insurgentes ou ao time de Segurança, ambos possuem suas próprias classes, armas e customizações, mas mesmo assim, o jogo consegue manter um balanceamento muito bom durante a partida.GRÁFICOS: Em relação aos gráficos é possível afirmar que é impressionante ver como os desenvolvedores trabalharam para otimizá-los ao máximo, mesmo com muitos elementos presentes durante uma partida isso não o torna pesado de maneira alguma, se destacam por serem bem modelados e com um acabamento excelente, o detalhamento dos cenários e das armas também impressiona.SONS/ÁUDIOS: Outro extremo ponto positivo de Insurgency é a quantidade de riqueza e qualidade dos sons das armas, ambientes e explosões, é possível você se imergir totalmente ao jogo, por conta destes que o fazem parecer que realmente está em uma guerra, no Workshop também é possível você alterar alguns sons de armas, explosões, e outros efeitos para deixá-lo ainda mais real.PING/FPS: O jogo possui uma renderização muita boa a qual o faz ser possível de rodar mesmo em computadores menos potentes (se você consegue rodar CS:GO com gráficos baixos a 60 FPS, provavelmente conseguirá jogar Insurgency sem nenhum problema), e os servidores respondem muito bem, até 200 de ping é possível você jogar sem nem mesmo perceber diferença ou interferência durante sua gameplay.JOGABILIDADE: A jogabilidade do Insurgency é um pouco diferenciada e por conta de o jogo tender mais para o realismo ela se torna um pouco mais complicada do que outros jogos de FPS que estamos acostumados, sempre sendo muito fluída e respondendo bem aos comandos solicitados, caso você seja iniciante em jogos do gênero pode ser que passe dificuldade para conseguir ter uma resposta rápida contra os inimigos ou mesmo uma noção de cobertura avançada. Aos mais veteranos em jogos FPS posso ter certeza que Insurgency fará com que você se torne melhor em basicamente todos os outros FPS' que você joga ou já jogou, por conta da estratégia e velocidade de reação que é necessária durante a partida.Não consegui encontrar nenhum individuo trapaceando seja com programas maliciosos ou com bugs no próprio jogo.DESENVOLVEDORES: Ativos e atentos, a equipe de desenvolvimento do Insurgency é um exemplo, sempre buscam lhe ajudar com qualquer dúvida ou problema que você tenha no jogo, ao contrário de muitos outros jogos, a comunidade desenvolvedora de Insurgency tenta manter um contato forte com o público jogando até mesmo partidas juntos com outros jogadores, é possível contatá-los através da Steam caso necessite de algo, o que faz o atendimento ser muito mais rápido e fácil.COMUNIDADE: No sentido da comunidade de jogadores do Insurgency, eu não posso analisar em relação a servidores asiáticos, da Oceania ou africanos, porém a comunide americana (toda a América, não só EUA) e europeia é muito amigável e receptiva (além de muito engraçada, ALLAHU AKBAR), em nenhuma partida que joguei consegui testemunhar atos que prejudiquem o gameplay de outros (como abusar do canal de voz, canal de texto, ou matar a própria equipe com intenção). O jogo permite que a comunidade poste Mods na workshop para diversificar e deixar o jogo com maior estilo do jogador assim como preferir.",2015,2

Beacoup n'aime pas ce jeu car ils ne peuvent le faire tourner sur le ordinateur ou à cause de crash répétitif. Depuis la dernière mise à jour, les nombreux crash ont été réctifié pour la pluparts. Deplus, je trouve normal que pour un jeu de cette qualitée, il faille-t-avoir un ordinateur correct (voir plus). Mon ordinateur est puissant, mais ce n'est pas le meilleur et pourtant, je fais tourner ACU en qualité élevé avec seulement quelques ralentissement au niveau des FPS. Pour les combat, généralement, je met en qualitée moyenne pour plus de fluidité. Certains sites ont été conçu pour améliorer vos FPS et empecher votre jeux de crash. Donc avant de le noter, commencer d'abord par tester complêtement le jeu, pas juste le lancer et publier un éval' négative juste à cause de problèmes de performance. Passons maintenant au jeu en lui même : Les graphismes sont un point important du jeu que je ne peut que remarquer malgré ma qualité graphique moyenne. La carte de Paris à été totalement reconstitué ainsi que les grands monument présent à l'époque (La cathédrale de Notre-Dame, le palais de Versaille, ect) qui ont été refait dans les moindres détails. Le système de coop est aussi un des points qui m'a le plus attiré dans ce jeu : la possibilité de faire les missions à plusieurs, de ce balader dans Paris avec ses potes. Ensuite il a le systeme des armes qui est une grande nouveautée. Nous ne sommes désormais plus limiter à une seul classe d'arme : nous pouvons utiliser une lance, une rapière, un fusil, une masse d'arme ou une hache. Le seul point encombrant est de devoir revenir à chaque fois sur le menu pour changer de style d'arme. En plus de pouvoir choisir entre plusieurs armes, la tenu est elle aussi modifiable, chaque élément rajoutant de la santé, de la portée ou de la discrétion. On peut aussi apprécier le systeme d'escalade qui a été remis à jour, nous permettant d'éviter plus facilement les obstacles de manière assez stylé. Les combats ont eux aussi été améliorer même si ils sont assez similaire à ceux de Assassin's creed Black Flag. Enfin, un des derniers points importants de ce jeu est le scénario qui me plait beaucoup pour le moment. N'ayant pas fini le jeu, je ne peux vous en expliquer les causes sans pouvoir vous spoïler.C'est pour ces multiples raisons que je trouve que Assassin's creed Unity est un bon jeu qui fait honneur à cette saga mythique.",2014,2

Quem se lembra do game dos meados dos anos 2000 vai se sentir em casa. É divertido relembrar mapas como Dust, Italy e Train e dá até uma vontade de chamar os amigos para jogar em casa.Mesmo assim, é um jogo que mostra sinais da idade: não foram feitas atualizações nem adicionadas novas mecânicas que justifiquem voltar ao game que, em sua essência, é o mesmo de anos atrás. Vale para quem está com saudades e quer variar um pouco da mesmice de jogar “Call of Duty”.• Pontos Positivos •Mecânica continua atual:Não há como negar: “Counter-Strike” é um jogo extremamente viciante. Mesmo quem se afastou do game - seja pelo motivo que for -, vai se sentir em casa. Afinal, pouco da mecânica foi alterado e o que mudou foi para deixar o game mais realista.Um desses exemplos é quando você usa o telescópio dos rifles de precisão, que deixa a tela um pouco embaçada quando o personagem se move.Mas há novidades também, como a interface de compra, que agora é circular - o que facilita e muito a navegação nas versões para consoles. Novas granadas também aparecem, como o coquetel molotov, que dá liberdade para criar estratégias diferentes. No final das contas, a mecânica de comprar armas em todos os rounds favorece quem joga com cautela e estrategicamente.A versão de PlayStation 3 tem ainda suporte para jogar com teclado e mouse, além do controles de PS Move. Já no X360 não existem tantas variações de controle (nem suporte ao Kinect) e o modo de chat em grupo é desativado – afinal isso poderia ser usado para trapaças, e “Counter-Strike” é um jogo que leva muito a sério a competitividade.Novos modos de jogo“Global Offensive” traz dois modos novos: o Arms Race e o Demolition. Mesmo sendo bem distintos, ambos compartilham de um descontraído espírito arcade e favorecem o confronto direto.Em Arms Race, o jogador ganha novas armas ao matar um adversário e passa por todas até chegar ao momento que se vê forçado a usar apenas a faca. São 26 armas no total e vence quem conseguir usar todas elas com sucesso ou quando o tempo se esgotar.Já em Demolition o esquema é o mesmo das missões de explosão, mas em cenários menores e com mais contato entre os times.  Além disso, o jogador só usa novas armas quando mata alguém do time adversário.Em todo caso, essas novas modalidades garantem um fôlego extra para quem é veterano e diversão imediata para quem ainda engatinha no game de tiro da Valve.Visual bonito""Counter-Strike: Global Offensive"" é muito bonito. É até estranho dizer isso, tendo em vista que a Source Engine, uma ferramenta de 2004, já não faz gráficos tão elaborados como a CryEngine (de “FarCry 3”) ou a Frostbite 2 (de “Battlefield 3”). Cenários como Aztec ou Italy são bem detalhados e divertidos de serem revisitados.Existem efeitos de luz dinâmica e fumaça volumétrica que enchem os olhos e esse resultado pode ser obtido mesmo em computadores com placas mais populares – leia-se: não muito caras.Por outro lado, é notável a queda de  qualidade gráfica nos consoles, principalmente no PlayStation 3, que mostra texturas mais lavadas e com taxa de atualização em 30 quadros por segundo - uma qualidade bem abaixo do que estamos acostumados a ver em jogos atuais.• Pontos Negativos •Poucas novidadesFaltam bons motivos para justificar o retorno de ""Counter-Strike"". Por mais que bata a saudade de reunir amigos para um 'corujão' em uma LAN House, fica a pergunta: por que jogar ""Global Offensive""?As duas novas modalidades e os mapas inéditos não são motivos suficientes para voltar ao mundo de “Counter-Strike”.  O mais provável é que, a longo prazo, as pessoas continuem jogando o modo clássico de “Counter-Strike” e nos mesmos mapas de sempre (Aztec, Dust, Italy etc.) - e se divertindo como sempre aconteceu nas versões 1.6 e “Source”.A situação é ainda mais complicada para quem joga nos consoles que, além de não poder jogar os mapas criados pela comunidade, ainda corre o risco de ser abandonado pela Valve, como já aconteceu com as versões de “Team Fortress 2” para X360 e PS3.",2015,0

I wouldn't say not to play them, but Team Fortress 2 is a good game to start your Steam experience. Team Fortress 2 is like practice for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive in a way that they are both shooter games. Team Fortress 2 also has as many players as Dota 2. There is a famous quote that says ""The more, the merrier"", right? This game supports that statement. There are a very small amount of empty servers every now and then, but there is always a server that is full (even during midnight!).

I really like this game, and recommend it to anyone that likes Lego and Marvel. Has a huge range of characters and has a large free-roam area to do what ever you want in. the only problem, only two boats, but that's not a big deal. The game can be a bit glitchly at times but keeps you entertained for hours. When i mean glitchy, i mean real glitchy. I found this glitch with Thor, where i turned into the citizen? And i found two spots where i could go under the city and onto the islands in the background? I also was on the other side of the bridge, where i couldn't go. What?When they say there are a lot of characters, they are correct, because there are something like over 100 playable, and thats without the DLC. The DLC was pretty good, giving you extra vehicles and characters, but most of their abilities were the same as other characters, so i recommend waiting until they are on special as they are not worth their full price. The steam achievments are also good and provide something else to do in the free-roam city. Just a warning, there are cheat codes, but the one for the hulkbuster prevents you from getting 100%, so i don't recommend using them.There are a lot of bonus levels, which some give a good laugh. Suitable for all ages, even little kittens. Score 9.5/10",2015,2

I loved running around like a mainiac shooting and killing people. It was so satisfying. It has around seven characters, which i think are only in this version of Broforce and they are badass.

You can drive in and out of the Batcave in free roam, as well as the the enterance for the Batboat and Batwing. I love everything except a couple annoying little things. It is always night and raining. This is exactly how i thought Gotham would look, but it gets a little annoying after a while. LEGO needed to make a daytime option for the game. The flying controls are a little frustrating, but i found myself not flying that much. There aren't a huge amount of characters, but you just have to make do with what you get. Green Lantern was the most dissappointing as you can't make anything with his ring, except for certain points in levels. And once you complete the game, there are some constructs that you can make that stretch all over Gotham. I found this really annoying as when you were driving you would have to doge them as it would sometimes flip your car/bike. One of the most annoying problems was that there were no steam achievements, so once you fully completed the game, there were no steam achevements to do. It sounds like this game is really bad, but i just pointed out the main problems with it, everything else is great.I highly recommend this game.Score: 8.5/10",2015,0

This game was imported directly from PS Vita to PC, and has many fans pleased since they may not own a Vita. The game uses the mechanics from Hyperdimension Neptunia Victory and Hyperdimesion Mk 2, the voice acting has been revamped as well due to this game being a remake and all. The story is as follows and it's basic and simple, go find the Key Fragments that reside in each of the four nations to get your shares and other nations shares back up. The thing is some of the CPU's may be hostile and choose not to help Neptune, so Neptune just goes to find them herself with IF and Compa. Overall this game is surprisingly good, both of the endings are really nice and look forward to. The characters each have their own personality and are very original, so I'll recommend this game to someone with minor JRPG and major JRP experience.",2015,2

We were getting constantly raided on a (Modded, aint nobody got time fo' that Vanilla stuff) server, we made a large town with the Admins of the server and named it ""Gastown"". It was probably the best settlement I ever built by far, fair distance away from the beach, slap dab in the middle of the desert landscape (There are three in total: Snow/Ice which wards off freshies and great for nighttime stalkin' [Stalkers gonna Stalk], Forest/Grasslands/Highlands for all the first-timers who enjoy being in the presence of Mutha Nature, and theres the Desert, desolate wasteland, lots of quarry and pumpjack locations, perfect for the marauders of the server.) and we had it all armoured (Tier 5 - Max Protection) up since we had more High Quality Metal than we knew what to do with, We slowly invited people into our settlement of Pumpjacks and Mining Quarries, we slowly began to become the biggest ""Band"" on the server.Long Story Short we got raided by DDOSing hackers that kicked off everyone on the server, including admins, and fly-hacked into our well-fortified complex, then ending the kick-wave and letting us spawn back into our bases to find that they were all C4'd. Thats one of the many struggles of Rust; Dem Hackers, EAC seemingly does JackSh*t against these hackers (VAC just likes to create problems on all other games that don't use Source) , but this is Rust. Those who played the ORIGINAL Alpha would have known that hackers were RAMPANT in that, thus one location on the old map dubbed ""Hacker Valley"", mainly because only hackers were able to get there in the first place. Like seriously, who DIDN'T hack back then?Jokes aside we were kinda fed up about the whole ordeal, so we took it upon ourselves and decided to go mess around with Ladders and Power Pylons (The BIG ones). We ended up trying to Spodermin up and trying to stand on it, which we so HILARIOUSLY failed hardcore, but then we discovered we could put SIGNS up on the Pylons, making a platform. What was even better was that we could place  FURNACES N' CHESTS N' SH*T  up on these sign-platforms. We pretty much had the most ♥♥♥♥♥ist base on the Server, hell, even the OWNER decided to come base up with us.We always had plenty of freshspawns (Nudemans) to harvest for food since they always tried to come up and raid us with rocks and spears, yet we still held our ground with just crossbows and Beancan Gurrnades. Best moment of Rust so far.-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-Storytime Aside, lets see the pros and cons of Rust: PROS:+ Well Built Engine.+ Uses Unity5, Uses It Well Too.+ Plenty Of Different Experiences Each Server. You never will know what may happen on the next server you join.+ Lotsa' Gunz! Rust has plenty of guns to fit everybody's playstyle. Like going as the Sniopah? Get a Bolty. Like it up-close-and-personal? Grab a Shotgun or Custom SMG. Pathfinder? Grab a Thompson/R250 (Rusted-P250) and slap on a suppressor. Light-Packer? Grab the R250 and knock in some Incendiary or Explosive ammo, you won't regret it. Wabbit Sesun-Hunter? Grab a Shotgun and load some Slugs. You'll have plenty of Newman carcasses to feed you for a while!As you see, these are just some of my Preset kits, but ofcourse you can go ahead and go full Pirate with the AK, dress in Red, and go raiding. Make some of your own combinations.+ Weekly Devblogs on what's going on, FacePunch does an excellent job of keeping the Community up-to-date on what they're doing every Friday of each week, and we can't forget their  Trello [trello.com] page where they post their conecepts on where to go for Rust, and it's great to say that the concept art they do is quite nice-looking too, especially the Trainyard Radtown concept (Lookin foward to it guys :]).+ Every Second-Week Updates, they do an amazing job of keeping to their update schedule unlike most other EA Devs.+ FUN! Theres alot of fun to be had in this game, like me and my mate how we discovered the Spodermin Pylons. All by Happy Mistakes!Now comes the Cons:- Hackers, OFC this was going to be one issue, but EAC and VAC are seemingly unable to deal with the hackers that run rampant on some servers. Theres always going to be someone who is able to crack the security. There is always a way in.- Admin Abuse, another big issue I forgot to mention, theres SOME servers that have 16y/o teens who think they can tell people what to do on the server and kick whoever they want just because their Iceberg base got raided (You will actually be suprised at the lengths people go to ♥♥♥♥ off an Admin, It is VERY Entertaining. :P).- SOMETIMES Game-Ruining Updates, I have ONLY encountered ONE of these bugs during a server restart, where the world would not save and WIPE the map of all bases. But this has been since resolved a few months ago.  Would I Recommend This Post-Apoccalyptic Manhunt With Explosives? [/i]   FU*K YES I WOULD! 10/10 IGN! 8/8 WHILE I FINGER MY PROSTATE!",2015,2

Perks in the skill tress can be unlocked through skill points that you earn through leveling up by completing multiple heists.Technician(Specialise in trip mines and saws,great to bring along for bank heists or maps that have atms) , mastermind (passive and active perks , highly recommnded for those who think they might mess up stealth or specailise in crowd control), ghost(the skill tree says it all , its like the sneaky-ish class of the game where its perks allow you to be fast and silent while being able to hack and take out your enemies one by one) and enforcer(heavy weapons guy,no further explaination needed here).Depending on what playstyle or class you prefer most(you can invest in multiple skill trees , blending different playstyles) , this is going to determine what role you play in the team of 4 players(fixed at 4 every heist) .There are a few key mechenics in the game , which i will point out in a moment .1.CamerasOn most maps , there will usually be cameras scattered around the map which will sound the alarm if they spot you or your associates.These cameras are monitored by a camera guard in a locked room(such doors can be opened through high-level ghosts , drills or keycards if you are lucky enough to find one.In most stealth missions , we heisters take killing the camera guard as the main priority so that we can progress more smoothly .You can shoot out a camera to get a guards attention(this causes them to patrol around the destroyed camera,but not be alerted).However , on higher diffuculties , cameras are protected by a bullet-proof barrier(these cameras are called TiTan cameras) , making it even harder for the heist to be completed.2.Guards Guards spawn throughout different maps and differ from level to level , and will alert other guards and sound the alarm if they spot you , so keep a lookout for these guys.Btw , they also drop a pager after being killed ,and you are required to answer the operator over the pager by pressing f , so dont mess up a nice heist by forgetting to answer them.Guards on different maps also have different health levels(also affected by difficulty levels).3.Stealth I cannot emphasise on this any more than i ever could .STEALTH is the main playstyle of the game(my personal opinion)In most missions , on higher levels , people tend to restart when they are spotted and if he alarm is raised because the resistance is very strong (polica forces have more health ,as well has high dps weapons).SO KEEP TO STEALTH.Finally , what about the communty?Well , occasionally , there WILL BE d***s , however , for the most part , everyones friendly because everyone wants to accomplish that ONE common objective(beware of grenade trolling dough , cause i do those as well ;)  )Trolls will be trolls , haters will be haters , but we will all be hesters , so yes , STOP READING THIS AND BUY THE GAME , AND PLAY IT NOW ,ALL PRAISE OVERKILLLLL",2014,2

There is the ability to buy (through the currency earned in the game) blueprints for new weapons and make them yourself. To do this you need to earn the resources through game play and by visiting different planets. You can play the game in solo mode which allows for a more leisurely game or you can play by inviting other players (through private mode) or play online with other players joining when they want to.I personally like to play online because this enables you to collaborate with other online players on missions. You can also set up a clan or you can ask to join an already established clan. Clans give you more support and great team work. You can buy (with game currency) special blueprints (not available through the store) from the clan research facilities through the clan dojo.,2014,2

I personally believe that this game is boring and unsatisfying. One of my main reasons for unsatisfaction is that I was a WC3 player and so I more enjoy games with an isometric camera to be about building an army and/or base. I prefer commanding armies but less so commanding a singular hero. I PERSONALLY believe that MOBAs should be more like Smite with a third person perspective. This makes the game feel more fast paced (which MOBAs are usually).

Before I talk about the positives I'm going to talk about the negatives which there are very few of yet still there. To start with it seems to be a bit expensive for what it is, I understand that maybe the devs need a bit more money to get more people into the game. Yet it does seem like it should be F2P seeing as it has microtransactions (optional) a difficult leveling up system and of course having the word online smacked straight into the title (not that all online games are f2p just that lots on steam are). The devs i think would get alot more sales if they lowered their prices down to below $10 or just make it f2p. Also at the time of this review post whenever I go on there only seems to be 100 - 400 people online which, lets be honest, isnt that much for a full online game, I have often either joined back to the same lobby I left or kept running into the same people even on different days. I do also understand that they cant just make more people play their game but this is still a flaw, it just needs time to fix.Dispite these negatives the game is still amazing, it has a vast array of mounted guns, repair tools, ammo types, power ups and it is a very team based game. The most amazing thing I've liked about it so far, is that it isnt just a run and gun shoot anything to move sort of game. There is actual strategy, for example if you had a motar and a gatling gun, yes the motar does more damage yet its not the greatest at taking down shields so you take down the shields with the gatling gun then fire the motar to do extreme damage and it takes down a ship faster then if you just shot wildly at them with both guns. SUM UP:Guns of Icarus is an amazing game and is some of the most fun I've had playing a game, if you're looking for a causual game to play it its probably not the best option but if you're looking for hours of intense fun with friends and other randoms this game is definatly worth the full $15 or even the $30 for 3 other copies to give away to your friends. This game is extremely recommended!",2015,2

With its amazing sense of satirical humor, Magicka really does bring out out the laughs very often. The game also has an amazing blend of gameplay, music (which I must say is very good for most Paradox games), and graphics, which really is great for the environment, but especially for the Magicks. I think the only con for this game is the optimization, which makes the game run dreadfully on potatoes. And majorly, the bugs, probably the biggest downside to this game, makes some areas almost unplayable. However, the support from Paradox is very good and really puts the game up-the scale.",2013,2

Let me unpack this for you - the size of this game and the density of activities in this space is astounding - I can walk for 5 minutes, and come across 3 or more activities or quests - a Super-mutant outpost, raiders, irradiated ghouls, etc. In this way the game is great value of money - if you enjoy this sort of repetitive activities, you could get hundreds of hours from this game. However the variety and general depth of these activites is limited; they are relatively similar. Now I'm going to go the traditional route of breaking my review down in terms of the seperate aspects of the game. Graphics  (6/9)I'm not a huge stickler for graphics - one of my favorite games of all time is Fallout 2 - I don't really care if the graphics don't hold up very well. The performance on my computer is fine, though I would recommend looking at a review where someone may have benchmarked the performance on specific systems for a more accurate summary. Audio / Music  (Hans Zimmer/10)You've probably heard about this - the theme is gorgeous, and music on the 'Diamond City Radio' station is quite nice, albeit repetitive and reasonably similar to the music from Fallout 3, though I enjoy it all the same. They added a lot of music - there are 35 songs in the Diamond City repertoire, as oppose to the 20 in Fallout 3. Plot / Story  (Spooky/666)The plot of the actual game is interesting, though the only really important choice you make being which faction you choose, which determines which one of 2 endings you get. For me this is where the game lacks - I wanted my choices as a character to make a difference. Sure the karma system in Fallout 3 (actions would give positive or negative karma, which would have reprecussions and impact the choices of dialogue and action available) wasn't perfect, but it was a hell of a lot better than what we have in this game. Another issue I have with the sidequests are the way in which they all involve nearly the same thing - you either shoot everyone / everything in the desired location, or you have high enough charisma to solve the situation - I have played around 20h (many offline) and haven't come across anything remotely different.  Gameplay  (meh/100)Relating to the aformentioned points, I think the only thing I have to talk about here is combat, settlement creation and dialogue, because that's it. Combat is great - for those expecting a solid open world shooter with RPG elements, this is for you. The guns feel great, and there are many, many of them with cool perks and a huge amount of modability. The fact that there is a nuke launcher is testament to this fact. Settlement building is meh - it's fun to do at first for a few hours, but it really leads nowhere. I was personally expecting some sort of diplomacy system between settlements, maybe some more inter-factional warfare with settlements breaking off and rebelling if you didn't take care of them adequately, but no. You build it, and you leave it...Lastly dialogue - it's already limited in terms of its impact on the narrative and generaly story through the lack of importance your choices have. This is increased by the way in which the dialogue options aren't descriptive - you may end up picking the wrong thing.  Final Remarks This game is great if you want an experience reasonably similar to Skyrim but with less depth in lore and more bombastic gameplay with cool guns that feel great. I personally feel like it is a devolution (if that's a word) from the previous Fallout games, though many who have not played those may enjoy it all the same.  Just play the Witcher ",2015,2

Along with these admirable qualities, FEZ brings new and innovative ideas to the platforming and puzzle genres, which we will hopefully see in future games.

Once you basically ""master"" the game there is nothing to work towards to or look forward to.",2013,0

With better graphics, new weapons and a nicer and easier interface to use, this game is truely a treat to get instead of of it's predecessors.Some bad things about this game are that it's graphics are now outdated compared to it's successors and that you can only play co-op multiplayer (only 2 players), so you can't play a giant rampage with 3 or more friends.In my final opinion, this is a fun and great game to play and have, especially if you have played any previous games in the series, even if you finished the game you can still play around with the game for as long as you want!This review was made with the help of my good friend ""MCZ - 1989""",2015,0

It didn't really have any lore but that doesn't matter considering it's free. The game is so simple that you don't even need the ability to read in order to figure out what's going on so even if you were my neglected goldfish, you should still be able to play. I found this game intersting considering that it's about the most creative thing you will find in the last two-three years. If you take a look at the amount of re-used jokes in Family Guy or the shooter genre, you would probably agree.Pros:It's freeThe tutorial shows gameplay while teaching you (which is cool I guess?)It's simpleIt's funIt's excitingIt's like a MOBA but funIt has few micro-transactions (I didn't really notice any but I'm pretty sure there are some)It has better animations than the latest Scooby-Doo series.The community isn't toxic (I suggest you become good before it does)Cons:THE TUTORIAL IS SO ♥♥♥♥ING LONG! THERE IS LIKE TWO PARAGRAPHS WORTH OF INFORMATION IN IT! (and no skip button :P)They didn't explain when the English version is gonna release (not that I'm complaining but it is bad for others)There is a framerate drop.It has a tendency to go into a process of crashing.The main menu may actually never load or show you how to begin to play as there are no buttons or loading signs...If I were you I would begin to play now before everyone else begins too however I'm not you and actually have a life away from the computer screen (the one by the TV where that rusty playstationboy 64 is kept). If you can't speak Russian, I suggest you just watch the gameplay and flashing arrows pointing at cool looking things during the tutorial as you might or might not learn something. If you told me you had a life away from anything electronic related, I would think you were lying and then tell you to wait for the English version but who knows how long that'll take?",2015,2

It's annoying how you do need CS: Source to view a lot of maps and items that most servers use but you can get those textures for free off of websites which is legal (just in case you think it isn't) or you can do it through a tiny bit more legitament way by buying it with Garry's Mod or standalone but I highly recommend buying it in a bundle as it does lower the price by quite a bit. If you can't be bothered installing all the textures by downloading them online then buying it would be better for you as all you need to do is download CS: Source and just go back onto Garry's Mod but if your like me and your going to barely play CS: Source then just buy it on a sale or download the textures (to be honest I did both because I downloaded the textures but about a month later the game was about $2 so I bought it anyway).7/10 for...Negatives:- Making it incredibly dificult to download the textures.- Forcing you to have them in the first place- Making CS:source way too overpriced considering it's not even that good compared to CS: GO which is newer and cheaper- No tutorials- Overly complicated tools considering thier is no tutorialPositives:- Lowering the price to $1 on sales- Making the original price $10 (considering its a online only game)- In-built workshop compatibility- So many different gamemodes- Some gamemodes are mixed in with others on some servers to create the ultimate game (sort of like Sandbox where you can do what you want and build with PVP where you can still do what you want but no flying through walls, building bases, killing others and still building amazing contraptions).In summary Garry's Mod is a great casual game that you can play everyday if you want but it isnt hardcore so it's meant to be more of a entertaining, funny game which is a lot better to play with friends and if you don't have friends then use a mic while playing on servers as it will be just as much entertaining (you don't have to have a mic either you can also type in chat).",2013,2

Each individual character has a story to tell and I thought that these were excecuted brilliantly. I also like the constant flow of DLCs each adding something new to the games already brilliant story. Weapons, shields, class mods and cash are always littering the battlefield after a match, although I have not been able to play with co-op I still find this game extremely enjoyable and that it keeps me interested at every turn and I shall continue to play this game further into the future.

Some things to remember though:-Don't rage quit.-Don't call someone a hacker just because they killed you (you're not invincible).-Understand that you will be killed and it will be annoying.-Learn to play before you throw loads of money into it.This game has a lot of good points and some bad ones but lets start with the pros.Pros:-Amazing character customisation with such fabulous hair colour options. :D-Great selection of guns, most of which are available through gameplay.-Shooting is fun and it's surprsingly accurate even without the ability to scope or use iron sights.-Basically everything is customisable in this game so you can make the most fabulous and or sexy, awesome, epic, frightning or badass character ever.-Driving was weird at first but when you get the hang of it, it becomes very rewarding.-Criminals have lots of side activities to participate in.-Didn't encounter many bugs or crashes.Cons:-Those who pay for the best gear have a definite advantage but are not invincible.-Without paying for premium there are customisation limitations which can be quite irritating.-There are way too many annoying little kids (9-14 or basically anyone with a level of maturity equal to those ages or less) playing this game even though its R18 which can be annoying.-Enforcers can only really do missions to get level up their contacts and make money. You can arrest criminals here and there IF YOU CATCH THEM IN THE ACT, they are usually pretty sneaky too and avoid the action, as you do.Overall there isnt much wrong with this game and it has what you would expect from a F2P game or MMO so I give in a 7/10",2014,2

Yea i know some times the enemy AI will not even try and harm you. The time it takes for the cops to show up is a little dumb its as if they are right around the corner it can take them about 30 secounds to mount a large scale assult. I was wishing that this game had more depth but i think i may be wrong i have played for about 24 hours so far basicly i got it sat down and pumped it till i got to lvl 50 (not hard) and found no story and little back story just a really fun co-op game has a bit of strategy which is always nice but i cant see a squael to this game happening because it was not really going anywhere i feelt (and valve cant count to 3) may just be updates and DLC for this game.Off-shore accounts: well you know that 22 million dollars you just stoll well its in an account over seas that you cant use to steal more money to repeat the process. basicly a very large sum of money you steal is transferd to this ''off-shore accout'' its basicly kissing your money away :( i have not found a use for off shore banking besides this gambling system i dont understand yet (you loose alot of money from it dont gamble kids).DLC: I dont really care much for the dlc in this game its just allot of stuff is locked the only snipers and LMG's in the game are sepert 5 dollar packs of DLC 3 snipers and 3 LMG's there are some other stuff but thats just knifes and masks which are cosmidic anyway.But really the good in this game fare out ways the bad RECOMMENED this game",2014,0

When you take damage in COD the screen would shake, you would hear grunts and a quick splash of red on the screen in the form of blood would appear. this is why this game feels so dull to me, no wieght to actions.Also mechanicly its dull, with dino's that just run at you and then a couple tanky ones where is the strategic puzzle?

You could also get into comp, if you win you could get a medal (trust me its better than it sounds) or you could just not win and play other fun gamemodes like, surf (Boom Boom), MvM (FOR THE LOLZ), cp_hydro (what is that?) or just some Valve server (always a guy with hats on, i can never kill skrubs without being sniped).

Do NOT play this. When you first log in you have you create an account like most Free To Plays. Once you finally get past the log in screen you have to deal with the terrible automated resoultion which by the way when you first launch the game you can't change because of the f**king useless tutorial, so if you have an adverage monitor like me you can't see the full screen until you manage to click away the tutorials, get into the menu and change the resoultion. Whats even more annoying is that you can't change the aspect ratio. Personally I play games at 4:3 because it reduces lag and feels like it reduces input lag. Whats even more terrible is that once you get into the game, even with maxed out sensitivity its still horribly low so its incredibly hard to aim. I wasn't able to get into a proper match as apparently there were net works issues.

The graphics in this game are unbelieveable with its texture and detail of just the ground its amazing.But after all the need of the Golden Eagle(In-Game Currency)is pretty much very high,im using the British planes who made it to the tier 4 who is always struggling with In-Game Credits. im ending up bankcrupt ,this is what i fear in high tier gaming the need of a higher currency of something premium just play without any loss.      The In-Game matchmaking is one the worst that i would review,The new tier system making a lot of pro players in tier 3 and the new players who just made it to the tier 3 are very unbalanced.Considering myself using Russian tier 3 planes i see this often sometimes i get too good because of the new players that i dont like it because its not challenging enough and a whole of pro players that pretty much dominates every one but some of those pro players are positive hacker because i once  saw a low tier plane(A6MN) just ripped a wing of a well armored bomber(B-25 Mitchell) in seconds of firing it.So the match making system one of worst in War Thunder    Overall:this game is perfect for the players bored with the ordinary First Person Shooter game,a high graphic picture,its more a pay to win game   ",2014,2
